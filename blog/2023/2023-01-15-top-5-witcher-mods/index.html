<p>I adore <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em>, but to pretend that it can&rsquo;t be improved is silly. I put off a replay until the &ldquo;next-gen&rdquo; patch released - complete with Icarian performance issues - but knew I wasn&rsquo;t going to go into it without some quality of life fixes and tweaks. The game is simply too massive, too big a commitment, to go through all the friction all over again. Agreeably, that friction is part of the romance of <em>The Witcher 3</em> the first time around, but we&rsquo;re here to visit old friends and slip back into familiar, muddy boots, not to play the way I did the first time around: an hour or two a day for almost six months, <em>becoming</em> a Witcher and doing a few objectives a day like it was my job. So, mods! Here are my must-haves so far:</p>
<h2 id=fast-launchhttpswwwnexusmodscomwitcher3mods7154-by-instantity><a href=https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/7154>Fast Launch</a> by Instantity</h2>
<p>This is just one of those classic game things - there&rsquo;s just too damn much wind-up to getting back into the game. Get rid of it and save precious minutes. The &ldquo;storybook&rdquo; narrations on loading screens are particularly grating over time, as there aren&rsquo;t enough of them to cover the huge amount of events that the game covers and the flat delivery isn&rsquo;t compelling or useful in the first place.</p>

<p>Weapon durability is a controversial mechanic at the best of times, but again, on a second or more playthrough being caught unawares during a fight and having your steel sword snap on you just isn&rsquo;t as fun. Weapon repairing in <em>The Witcher 3</em> mainly exists to reinforce the ultimate lesson: be prepared. Oils, decoctions, bombs, sign buffs, armor buffs, weapon buffs - all that can stay, but taking a break from this particular busywork isn&rsquo;t a violation of the spirit, at least not to me.</p>
<h2 id=fast-travel-from-anywherehttpswwwnexusmodscomwitcher3mods7157-by-instantity><a href=https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/7157>Fast Travel From Anywhere</a> by Instantity</h2>
<p>Similar spirit but bigger change for sure. I like not being able fast-travel <em><strong>to</strong></em> anywhere, but it definitely becomes necessary to be able to travel <em><strong>from</strong></em> anywhere. Remembering that a particular area in south of Velen, at the very border of the map, isn&rsquo;t somewhere you should be right now is a good experience, but hustling your way back through it for the nearest sign isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<h2 id=leave-roach-alonehttpswwwnexusmodscomwitcher3mods7582-by-leotenebris><a href=https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/7582>Leave Roach Alone</a> by LeoTenebris</h2>
<p>What an incredible world we live in, where a horse-conscious fan can dig in and comment out a few lines of code that make Geralt act like a dickhole to his horse. No matter your feelings on Roach&rsquo;s dependability or sanity, she deserves better. And so do you - there&rsquo;s not exactly a lot of variety here either.</p>
<h2 id=grammar-of-the-pathhttpswwwnexusmodscomwitcher3mods7185-by-paulr0013><a href=https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/7185>Grammar of the Path</a> by paulr0013</h2>
<p>As marvelous the writers at CDPR are, they aren&rsquo;t infallible, and you can&rsquo;t expect a game with something like 450,000 words in its script not need a thorough copyedit. Is this perhaps the kind of thing that should have been fixed as part of the &ldquo;next-gen&rdquo; patch? Yes. It doesn&rsquo;t appear to be, so might as well grab this anyways.</p>
<h2 id=smooth-camera-motionhttpswwwnexusmodscomwitcher3mods7155-by-bojdeuca><a href=https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/7155>Smooth Camera Motion</a> by Bojdeuca</h2>
<p>I hate motion sickness. I get motion sickness. Every game should have this option.</p>
<h2 id=real-cheating-yen-and-trisshttpswwwnexusmodscomwitcher3mods7553-by-freakvip><a href=https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/7553>Real Cheating Yen And Triss</a> by FreakVip</h2>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s the ones that&rsquo;s weirdest to write about but it&rsquo;s just true - I don&rsquo;t want to have to pick! Both are written excellently and make valid authorial cases for their romance paths, as Triss and Yennefer forever represent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6PUReOuHVw">two sides of Geralt</a>: who he is, and who he wants to be.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also great power in forcing the player to pick, and on a first playthrough it <em>should</em> be something the player agonizes over - it&rsquo;s a choice core to many of the game&rsquo;s theses about found families, healing from trauma, and sense of duty to live life fully.</p>
<p>But you know what I&rsquo;m impatient and greedy already as a I try so hard to recreate a once in a lifetime gaming experience, so yeah I installed this. I&rsquo;m not proud.</p>
