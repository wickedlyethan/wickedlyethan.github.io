                    I really freaking miss Windows 7. I installed Release
                    Candidate 1 (RC1, released April 30, 2009) on our family
                    computer without asking, knowing damn well that if I
                    accidentally erased the main windows XP partition
                    <em>again</em>
                    I'd be in so much trouble. I burned that shit to a DVD and
                    got cracking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The smooth glass, the round Windows logo in the start
                    button, the transparent windows; everything that was oblong
                    and beveled and beige in XP was now reflective, razor-sharp,
                    and and contemporary. I adored it from the moment I got it
                    to boot. (Thank goodness I got it to boot.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Still, I was running Windows 7 RC1 on an already-aged HP
                    Pavilion desktop with an NVIDIA graphics card I can't even
                    remember the model number of. I
                    <em>do</em>
                    remember praising the gods that I had accidentally gotten my
                    dad to buy the right one when we discovered, as we plugged
                    it in, that it was AGP interface, not PCI. (I also remember
                    it not being one of the cool cards that had a character on
                    the
                    <a
                        href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/9/9274915/graphics-card-boxes-weird-art">
                        box or heatsink
                    </a>
                    .)
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used to run a utility called AlacrityPC so I could play
                    <em>Crysis</em>
                    (2007) at maybe 25 frames per second at 1024x768 on our
                    flat-panel, square, 17" Dell monitor. What did the utility
                    do? Well, it shut down just about every part of the
                    operating system that wasn't spitting out frames of games:
                    stop all the services, cease rendering the wallpaper, shut
                    down explorer.exe. It temporarily deleted as much of Windows
                    7 as it could so I could play
                    <em>Fallout 3</em>
                    and
                    <em>Far Cry 2</em>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of particular recent relevance, I recklessly installed
                    Windows 7 because I was
                    <em>excited</em>
                    for it. We had skipped over Vista for a host of reasons, but
                    the PC enthusiast world – which I had access to via
                    magazines like
                    <em>Maximum PC</em>
                    and
                    <em>PC Gamer</em>
                    , was pumped for a return to form, for a fundamentally look
                    and feel for an operating system. Nowadays I do my best to
                    avoid the OS as much as I can, and use
                    <a href="https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil">
                        utilities
                    </a>
                    to scrape the goo off its surface to make it more palatable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Windows 7 was excited for you to come on in and make
                    yourself comfortable, and I miss that.
