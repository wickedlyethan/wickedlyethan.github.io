                    I really freaking miss Windows 7. I installed Release
                    Candidate 1 (RC1, released April 30, 2009) on our family
                    computer without asking, knowing damn well that if I
                    accidentally erased the main XP partition
                    <em>again</em>
                    I'd be in so much trouble. I burned that shit to a DVD and
                    got going.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The smooth glass, the round Windows logo in the start
                    button, the transparent windows; everything that was oblong
                    and beveled and beige in XP was now reflective, beautifully
                    curved, and contemporary. I adored it from the moment I got
                    it to boot. (Thank goodness I got it to boot.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Still, I was running Windows 7 RC1 on an already-aged HP
                    Pavilion desktop with an XFX NVIDIA card I can't even
                    remember the model number of. I
                    <em>do</em>
                    remember praising the gods that I had accidentally gotten my
                    dad to buy the right one when we discovered, as we plugged
                    it in, that it was AGP interface, not PCI. (I also remember
                    it not being one of the cool cards that had a character on
                    the
                    <a
                        href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/9/9274915/graphics-card-boxes-weird-art">
                        box or heatsink
                    </a>
                    , which was a bummer.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used to run a utility called AlacrityPC so I could play
                    <em>Crysis</em>
                    at maybe 25 frames per second (remember
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraps">Fraps</a>
                    ?) at 1024x768 on our square flat-panel 17" Dell monitor. It
                    shut down just about every part of the operating system that
                    wasn't spitting out frames for games: stop all the services,
                    don't render the wallpaper, kill explorer.exe. It
                    temporarily deleted as much of Windows as it could so I
                    could lose myself in
                    <em>Fallout 3</em>
                    and
                    <em>Far Cry 2</em>
                    .

                    Of recent relevance, I recklessly installed Windows 7
                    because I was
                    <em>excited</em>
                    for it. We had skipped over Vista by accident really, but
                    the PC enthusiast world – magazines like
                    <em>Maximum PC</em>
                    and
                    <em>PC Gamer</em>
                    – was pumped for a return to form, for a fundamentally new
                    look and feel for an operating system. Nowadays I do my best
                    to avoid the OS as much as I can. (Update: I switched off
                    Windows entirely in 2025, switching to macOS for daily
                    driving and Linux for gaming.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Windows 7 was excited for you to come on in and make
                    yourself comfortable, and I miss that.
