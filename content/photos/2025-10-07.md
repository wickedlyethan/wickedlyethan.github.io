Olympus E-M10 MkIV, Panasonic Lumix G 14mm f/2.5

It's Arlo's 8th adoptiversary!!

The first picture is one of the first photos I ever took of him, when he was small enough to fit inside the window track of our college house rental. The second is one of the last photos I took of him in our horrible old apartment we moved out of this year, where he's spent most of his life; the last is the first proper photo I've taken of him in our new place, where, just like when he was a kitten, he can settle into window sills and get some sun.
