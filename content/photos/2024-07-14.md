Olympus PEN E-PL8, Panasonic Lumix G 14mm f/2.5

I got a new camera! Specifically an Olympus PEN E-PL8, thus inducting myself into the micro four thirds cult. I wanted to move away from the bland colors of my Sony a6000 and I'm thrilled with what I'm getting straight out of camera with the Olympus, before I even mess around with art filters or learn how to do better edits. It came with a Panasonic Lumix G 14mm f/2.5 ASPH II Lens that I'm finding sharp and delightfully compact.
