These are some of my favorite photos I've taken lately! I shoot primarily on a [Sony a6000](https://www.sony.com/et/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-6000-body-kit) with a [TTArtisan 25mm f/2 lens](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1725972-REG/ttartisan_c2520_b_e_25mm_f_2_aps_c_compact.html), or my Pixel 8.
