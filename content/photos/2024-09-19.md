Fujifilm X100T

_sigh_, I bought another camera. I got an incredible deal on a Fujifilm X100T and I'm only just beginning to learn it. It's got some quirks for sure, but the film simulations and ergonomics are a pretty incredible package. This is the first shot I'm happy with, taken during a suitably spooky apple-themed food event hosted at one of our favorite restaurants and its absurdly picturesque backyard.
