Ilford Sprite 35-II, Ilford HP5 Plus Black and White

The Sprite 35-II didn't do so well with a roll of Ilford HP5, but the images do take on a nice impressionistic vibe at times. This walk around the the local swimming hole is both beautiful and bizarre – it used to go by "Hell Pond" and is [65 feet deep](https://www.mass.gov/doc/mirror-lake-and-little-mirror-lake-in-devens/download) in places. 1920's rocket scientist Robert Goddard used to [walk its borders](https://www.nashobavalleyvoice.com/2007/10/26/mirror-lake-known-as/) and fished there while working out of Camp Devens. Nowadays there are signs to not eat the fish due to PFAS and mercury.
