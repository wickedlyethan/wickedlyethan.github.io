We finally made it out to San Jose to see Emily's sister and she gave us an intense and amazing itinerary. We went to Yosemite over the weekend and hiked Sentinel Dome before descending into the rest of the park – it was our first national park and it set the bar incredibly high. Then Emily and I did Big Sur and the Monterey Bay Aquarium, the latter of which absolutely blew my mind. It was a short trip filled with huge sights and totally new biomes for us.
