Ilford Sprite 35-II, Kodak Ultramax 400

Influenced by Becca Farsace's video about [cheap film cameras](https://youtu.be/udwdvn4CkUM?feature=shared) I grabbed a "reusable disposable" Ilford and some film from the good folks at [Reformed Film Lab](https://reformedfilmlab.com/), brought them on family vacation, and the developed photos just came back!

Something new to learn was, to add to the expense and inconvenience of film, there's the lack of metadata and generic filenames for scanned images. It was fun for these two rolls to reverse-engineer dates for the photos, but if I had more than two that would get old real fast. Just another way that the romance and undeniable beauty of film clashes with the modern age of photos.

And I think these photos are beautiful. They were super easy to take with the Sprite 35-II, which because it was a $14 camera produces more of an accidental beauty than an intentional one, but these shots are from a beach we went to when I was a kid and returned to with my toddler niece, so there's layers of nostalgia and timelessness – I bet I could lie to you about when these photos were taken and get away with it.
