Hi! I'm Ethan and I'm a technical writer in biotechnology. 

I love books and movies, have a love-hate relationship with games, play drums, and am getting back into photography. I try to be thoughtful about media and tech - the things I love I really love and the stuff I hate I try to understand, at least.

I have a lot of stories I want to tell and am constantly struggling to carve out the time in life to write them, so I call myself a "writer" aspirationally for now!

I have a deeply adversarial relationship with platforms and social media, so part of my perennial tinkering with this site is to work that out. I hope I post stuff that people like, but if not then it's still a great exercise in creativity and finishing things!

## Now?

I just resigned from the longest job I've ever had after getting recruited for a much better/cooler/higher-paying opportunity! I'm nervous and excited and am having a real hard time giving a damn for the last two weeks I begrudgingly gave. â€“ 2024-04-07
