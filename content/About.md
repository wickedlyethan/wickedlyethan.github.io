Hi! I'm Ethan! I'm an aspiring writer from Massachusetts. Professionally I'm a technical writer in healthcare and biotechnology despite studying game design in college. 

I love books and movies, have a love-hate relationship with games, play drums, and am getting back into photography. I try to be thoughtful about media and tech - the things I love I really love and the stuff I hate I try to understand, at least.

I have a lot of stories I want to tell and am constantly struggling to carve out the time in life to write them, so I call myself a "writer" aspirationally for now!

I have a deeply adversarial relationship with platforms and social media, so part of my perennial tinkering with this site is to work that out. I hope I post stuff that people like, but if not then it's still a great exercise in creativity and finishing things!
