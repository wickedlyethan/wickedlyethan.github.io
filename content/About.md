Hi! I'm Ethan! I'm an aspiring writer from Massachusetts. Professionally I'm a technical writer in healthcare and biotechnology despite studying game design in college.

I love books and movies, have a love-hate relationship with games, play drums, and am getting back into photography. I try to be thoughtful about media and tech - the things I love I really love and the stuff I hate I try to understand, at least.

I have a lot of stories I want to tell and am constantly struggling to carve out the time in life to write them, so I call myself a "writer" aspirationally for now!

I have a deeply adversarial relationship with platforms and social media, so part of my perennial tinkering with this site is to work that out. I hope I post stuff that people like, but if not then it's still a great exercise in creativity and finishing things.

Check out my:

- [Now]({{<ref "/Now">}}) page to see the latest about what I'm up to
- [Uses]({{<ref "/Uses">}}) page for what kind of gear and gadgets I use
- [Blogroll]({{<ref "/Blogroll">}}) for sites and newsletters I like

## The site

My little site is built on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) entirely through [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on my M1 Macbook Air.

After years of struggling to come up with a great identity via design I decided to go as minimalist as possible â€“ read more about it here: ["Oops I Re-Did My Stylesheet Again"]({{<ref "/blog/2024-04-09 Oops I Re-Did My Stylesheet Again.md">}})
