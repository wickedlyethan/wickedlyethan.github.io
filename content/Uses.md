I love tech and gadgets and thinking about how my setups have changed over the years. Following in the footsteps of [many](https://uses.tech/) indieweb-ers, here's my Uses page where I list out stuff I use and love!

## Apps

Everyone runs their lives out of apps, but I *really* can't live without my to-do list and second-brain apps. It's probably a problem, but we're going to pretend it's fine.

- [TickTick](https://www.ticktick.com/) for to-do lists
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for my second brain / personal knowledge base
- [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) for focused writing
- [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com) to further the great cause of RSS
- [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/u) to read longer things from the internet
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for making this website
