I love tech and gadgets and thinking about how my setups have changed over the years. Following in the footsteps of [many](https://uses.tech/) indieweb-ers, here's my Uses page where I list out stuff I use and love!

`Last Updated: {{% param updated %}}`

## Computers

- Apple Macbook M1 Air (my favorite, most used)
- Synology DiskStation DS118
- DIY Windows desktop with an i5-9600k, RTX 2070 Super, 16gb of RAM, and all SSD storage
- Raspberry Pi 4 for my homelab with a Hifiberry Digi+ S/PDIF output for music streaming

## My desk

I work from home, so my desk is an important place and I recently did a big upgrade to a electric sit/stand desk.

  - Grovemade walnut desk shelf and matte natural linoleum desk pad
- 27" 1440p 144hz Dell gaming monitor with G-Sync

## Writing

I went through a decade-long relationship with Moleskines ever since I bought my first while on a trip to England as a kid, but recently I leveled up my paper and pens without hopefully becoming a snob (ok maybe a little bit).

- Stalogy 016 Notebook B5 Lined notebook for journaling
- Midori B6 Slim notebook for ideas and keeping in my EDC bag
- Lamy Safari charcoal fountain pen, fine nib
- Pilot Kak√ºno fountain pen, extra-fine nib
- Herbin Bleu des Profondeurs ink, Ocean Depths Blue
- Sharpie S-Gel metal barrel or Uniball Signo gel pens

## Apps

Everyone runs their lives out of apps, but I *really* can't live without my to-do list and second-brain apps. It's probably a problem, but we're going to pretend it's fine.

- [TickTick](https://www.ticktick.com/) for to-do lists
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for my second brain / personal knowledge base
- [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/) for bookmarks
- [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com) to further the great cause of RSS
- [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/u) to read longer things from the internet
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for making this website
