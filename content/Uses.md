I love tech and gadgets and thinking about how my setups have changed over the years. Following in the footsteps of [many](https://uses.tech/) indieweb-ers, here's my Uses page where I list out stuff I use and love!

## My desk

I work from home, so my desk is an important place and I recently did a big upgrade to a electric sit/stand desk.

- Flexispot E7 standing desk in black walnut
  - Grovemade walnut desk shelf and matte natural linoleum desk pad
- 27" 1440p 144hz Dell gaming monitor with G-Sync
  - BenQ Screenbar monitor light (absolute game changer)
- KBDCraft Adam keyboard with GMK Grand Prix keycaps and a custom BNC-connector cable
- Logitech G603 mouse (2017, still going)
- Logitech Lift vertical mouse for work
- Stream Deck Mk.2
- Yeti Snowball ICE (got it for $20 at a pawn shop)
- JDS Labs Atom DAC and amplifier stack, version 1
  - Feeds into my ancient Sherwood stereo receiver, which was a gift for my 16th birthday along with my wonderful, dependable Pioneer SP-BS22-LR speakers,
  - Or into my Sennheiser HD 598 headphones, which you'll claw from my cold, dead hands
- Art by Daniela Gamba, Mike Krahulik, Mike Maihack, Supergiant Games, The Robotorium, and my amazing wife.

## Writing

I went through a decade-long relationship with Moleskines ever since I bought my first while on a trip to England as a kid, but recently I leveled up my paper and pens without hopefully becoming a snob (ok maybe a little bit).

- Stalogy 016 Notebook B5 Lined notebook for journaling
- Midori B6 Slim notebook for ideas and keeping in my EDC bag
- Lamy Safari charcoal fountain pen, fine nib
- Pilot Kak√ºno fountain pen, extra-fine nib
- Herbin Bleu des Profondeurs ink, Ocean Depths Blue
- Sharpie S-Gel metal barrel or Uniball Signo gel pens

## Apps

Everyone runs their lives out of apps, but I *really* can't live without my to-do list and second-brain apps. It's probably a problem, but we're going to pretend it's fine.

- [TickTick](https://www.ticktick.com/) for to-do lists
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for my second brain / personal knowledge base
- [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/) for bookmarks
- [Habitica](https://habitica.com/) for habit gamification
- [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com) to further the great cause of RSS
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for making this website
