subtitle: Sadly no catchy Muse song to go with this one, but we went outside in the cold and dark to see something amazing.

Honestly, space freaks me out. I love space in fiction – the big dreams, the procedural thrills, the brutish simplicity of “out there will kill you” – but in real life, not so much. Trying to wrap my head around the universe gives me anxiety.

That didn’t stop us from venturing into the frigid night on Wednesday to catch a glimpse of the aurora! Here in central Massachusetts it was barely visible with the naked eye, but phones with night modes were able to capture the phenomena.

Almost as nice to see as the aurora itself was the amount of people out in the dark excitedly snapping pictures. We went to the town beach, a field outside of town, and a historic hill; at every stop there were people despite the almost-freezing temperature. It was a cool community moment. But on the way home, I remembered one last spot to try: a cul-de-sac at the top of a hill, rung by shockingly ugly McMansions. It was the jackpot, with a clear view North and no one else there.

Once we were back warmly inside I engaged in a good ol’ fashioned Wikipedia rabbit-hole about auroras and their chief cause: [interplanetary coronal mass ejections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection) (ICME). Very basically: the sun “burps” – as Emily put it – plasma, creating a geomagnetic storm that makes Earth’s [magnetosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere#Earth's_magnetosphere) light up. The Space Weather Prediction Agency is a real thing as part of NOAA and they use the [G-scale](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/noaa-scales-explanation) to measure the severity of solar storms. The aurora we saw was caused by a G4 (Severe) storm.

The most intense geomagnetic storm in recorded history was the [Carrington Event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrington_Event) in September 1859 and the resultant auroras were seen around the globe! The storm crashed telegraph systems and electrified their operators; two operators in Boston and Portland, Maine, shut off their power supplies but kept communicating for two more hours, their telegraphs sent only by the ambient current in the atmosphere caused by the storm. (We love some local history.)

If a geomagnetic storm the severity of the Carrington Event hit today, it’d be a complete disaster. Satellites would be fried, blackouts would be global, and power transformers would be irrevocably damaged, taking [years to replace](https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/planetary-science/23jul_superstorm/). In the meantime, your worst uncle would be thrilled.

I conclude that space still freaks me out, but seeing the aurora borealis proper has made it to the bucket list.
