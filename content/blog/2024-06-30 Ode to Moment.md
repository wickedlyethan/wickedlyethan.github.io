A couple of things are true at the same time:

- Smartphone cameras are pretty fantastic nowadays, and pretty much any camera in a smartphone will get you "good" photos.
- By trying to post-process their way to "perfect" photos, the photos we take on our phones are getting a bit weird and kind of boring.

Before the trend of [digicams](https://www.polygon.com/24158881/tiktok-retro-digital-camera-trend) – a bandwagon I happily jumped on a few weeks ago with a $6 Savers find that I've taken a bunch of fun photos with – there were a lot of efforts to try and make your smartphone camera better, different, and more "cinematic".

I bought the Moment anamorphic smartphone lens back in late 2020 because I wanted something different from my smartphone photos. I am a huge aspect ratio dork – I have favorites (1.66:1) and least favorites (2.4:1) – so getting to take photos and make them look bigger-than life and otherworldly through hardware, instead of through editing, was exciting. Later I was thoughtfully given the 58mm telephoto lens, which promised a further reach than any smartphone I had ever had.

The reality was honestly pretty meh! Moment's app, which could de-squeeze the anamorphic photos automatically, was iPhone exclusive and I had a Google Pixel 3a. Said Pixel 3a was, after all, merely a cellphone with a minuscule 1/2.55" sensor, so there were no details to be found nor a lot of room to work with these photos in editing. Said photos had to be de-squeezed and edited later on a computer anyways, though I think at one point I had a [Snapseed](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niksoftware.snapseed&hl=en_US) workflow, and by the time you get most dinky phone photos onto a monitor what little magic there was is  gone. The noise is unpleasant, the colors either amped up by robots or flat, the lenses neither sharp nor interestingly bad. Either lens added a huge weird weight to the back of your already too-large phone, and switching between them was a pain (though no more a pain than switching lenses on a "proper" camera, which I also hate doing).

Moreover there is something simply uninspiring about phone photos. Maybe it's their ubiquity, or the lack of friction, or the feeling that we don't fully understand how the input became the output. ["Computational photography"](https://petapixel.com/computational-photography/) is a short hand for a long-running trend in making photo nerds and tech journalists freak out about [what even a photo is](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/7/23906753/google-pixel-8-pro-photo-editing-tools-ai). The Moment lenses didn't fix that – it's still a smartphone, and I defaulted to using the default Pixel camera app because it did enough post-processing to make the photos pleasing enough.

Moment updated its lens mounting system in September of 2023 to keep up with changes to smartphone designs, and now my original anamorphic was incompatible with my new phone. This is totally understandable, and they even offered a recycling program with a discount on new lenses, but for some baffling reason you had to have proof of purchase to get the measly $50 per lens. I didn't have one for my anamorphic and the telephoto was a gift, so screw me I guess. I sold both my lenses last week on eBay for $70 – 30% of their original value, which stings in a world where ancient digicams are selling for $100, 10-year-old Ricohs are $500, and some used Fujis are selling for more than their MSRP.

This all sounds pretty negative, but that's because I went through some surprisingly big feelings when I sold these lenses. There was an aspirational quality to them, a yearning to capture life beautifully with the tools we always have on us. I wanted to share my favorites, because when they worked these lenses did make photos special – primarily they made colors more vivid and added fun fringing and distortion at the edges. These photos are from 2020-2023, captured on either a Pixel 3a or Pixel 4a 5G, using the Moment anamorphic and 58mm lenses.
