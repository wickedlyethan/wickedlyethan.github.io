Perhaps you've heard, but there's an election haunting our calendars.  Never mind that in America they haunt our calendars for [far, far too long](https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/10/21/450238156/canadas-11-week-campaign-reminds-us-that-american-elections-are-much-longer), but we all know that only [7 states matter](https://time.com/7009161/battleground-swing-states-2024-election/).

Obviously it's your civic duty to vote, but in certain places it can feel like the presidential vote is decided for your area, and that you're just contributing to the popular vote score that will be ignored. To stave off the dread, I love learning more about ballot initiatives.

In Massachusetts we're blessed with interesting and complex ballot initiatives – in recent years we've approved better conditions for farm animals, forced companies to give sick time to workers, expanded rights to repair for cars, and much more.

In the past I've felt rewarded for learning more about these issues and posting about them on social media, where friends and family let me know they appreciated the attempt at nuance and accessible information. Well, I don't have any social media anymore, but I can blog whenever I want! This post is for me to learn out loud about the 2024 ballot initiatives for Massachusetts. I'll include my sources, sorted in alphabetical order, and try to write like a normal person.  

Disclaimer: I am in no way saying I'm an expert on these issues nor am I presenting a perfect, unbiased viewpoint on them! I'm trying to think my way through the ballot initiatives and at least check on different perspectives.

Disclaimer 2: I can't learn about all of these in one day, so I'll keep updating the post as I learn more!

To get started, I went to [Turbovote](https://turbovote.org/) to get caught up on my ballot and the initiatives, then started searching for news stories about each one. I found the Tufts [Center for State Policy Analysis](https://cspa.tufts.edu/2024-ballot-questions) valuable as high-level, plain-language explanations of each side's positions.

This year we have 5 ballot questions, and they're all pretty substantial. Let's dive in.

## Question 1 – Auditing the state legislature

> Authorize the state auditor to audit the state legislature, and remove some existing regulations regarding the auditing process

- [In Massachusetts, Once A Leader In Government Transparency, Key Votes Are Hidden From The Public](https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickgleason/2022/01/12/in-massachusetts-once-a-model-in-government-transparency-key-votes-are-hidden-from-the-public/)
- [Mass. ballot question 1: Should the state auditor be able to audit the Legislature? – NBC Boston](https://www.nbcboston.com/news/politics/mass-ballot-question-1-state-auditor/3512948/)
- [Open States' Legislative Data Report Card - Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/Open_States%27_Legislative_Data_Report_Card)

According to Ballotpedia's legislative report card, Massachusetts is one of the least transparent legislatures in the country, earning an "F" grade alongside illustrious company such as Alabama, Kentucky, and Nebraska. (To be clear, this is a supra-partisan issue: California and Rhode Island both earned "D" grades.) Our state has a rich history of corruption and scandal that I've only begun to learn about in recent years as our state police constantly [bathes in shit](https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/2024/05/22/after-years-of-scandals-have-the-massachusetts-state-police-turned-a-corner/) and our state government waits until the last minute to [pretend to try to pass anything](https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2024-08-01/mass-lawmakers-adjourn-after-all-night-session-with-a-housing-bill-passed-but-not-much-else).

Looking at specific house committees for example, shows no record of them meeting or planning to meet, such as the [House Committee on Global Warming and Climate Change](https://malegislature.gov/Committees/Detail/H51/About) or [House Committee on Ethics](https://malegislature.gov/Committees/Detail/H38); joint committees on [Public Health](https://malegislature.gov/Committees/Detail/J16/Members) and [Education](https://malegislature.gov/Committees/Detail/J14/Members) haven't met since 2023, per their own records. There might be some good reasons for this, there might not. Let's just say it's not a great look for the state house right now. (To be clear on this tangent, the state auditor could not look into committee assignments, but it's a good example of the lack of transparency.)

Enter Diana DiZoglio, a former state senator and now elected state auditor, who is championing this ballot initiative to give her office the explicit power to audit the Massachusetts legislature. Her zeal is commendable, but I don't love that the ballot initiative is so tightly tied to her – she [ran her campaign](https://www.dianaforma.com/my-audit-plan) on gaining this power and now has to deliver, as opposed to this being something approached only on its merits or the principle of the thing.

Towards the principle of the thing, as WBUR points out, "unlike other ballot initiatives, Question 1 has no registered opponents." It's hard to be against auditing politicians, who we instinctively believe are corrupt and, as mentioned, have a history of corruption. Auditing them can only bring more information to voters to make informed decisions on their representatives.

In response to worries that the state auditor would grow too powerful, and perhaps be another leverage point for corruption, there appear to  safeguards built in: "core legislative functions" (voting, committee assignments) can't be audited, audits can only result in investigations and studies, and the legislature's members can, and in all likelihood will, be assholes about the whole thing, which would reduce the efficacy of the audits happening but expose members for being against audits in the first place, which is itself valuable information.

I personally can't think of any reason to be against someone doing more investigation into politicians at any level, so I'm strongly in favor of this ballot initiative.
