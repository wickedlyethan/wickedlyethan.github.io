With the release of the [Light Phone 3](https://www.thelightphone.com/lightiii), a gorgeously designed but preposterous little brick of a “minimalist phone” – real ones remember the  [Punkt MP01](https://www.punkt.ch/en/products/mp01-mobile-phone/) as the first contender for this throne – the discourse of dumb phones is back for another round.

Not that it ever went away! Here’s but a sampler of recent posts:

Let’s make this clear: **This is a good idea with bad branding and nonsensical dogma**.

Let's start with the premise that we all agree that phones are incredible machines and capable of a great many things. They are, definitionally, “smart”. Right? So what does a "dumb phone" really mean?

I’m going to use this article, [“The DIY Dumbphone Method” by Casey Johnston](https://www.shesabeast.co/the-diy-dumbphone-method/), as an example to deconstruct. To be clear, the author seems cool, so this is in no way to disrespect her but to disagree with the traps that she – and many other tech bloggers – fall into on this topic.

Johnston opens as I have, mentioning the supposed rise of dedicated dumb phones like the Light Phone, and the apocryphal trend of Gen Z “using” flip phones. She concludes, correctly: “You don't need a separate, dumber device.”

Instead, she advocates for backing up your device and performing a factory reset; removing as many stock apps as possible; installing the bare minimum apps you need, and disabling all notifications from them. So far so good. She’s the only blogger I’ve seen who concedes that people use their phones constantly for maps.

But step three is where I get tripped up: “I considered getting rid of Safari, and I still probably should.” And in step five: “For the love of god, no email apps.”

I’ve seen other bloggers advocate for no email apps, and I’ve heard an apocryphal story of educational YouTuber CGP Grey using parental controls on an iPhone to remove Safari, and I don’t freaking get it. Combined with not a single mention in the above articles about installing your password manager of choice, I’m left to think that none of these bloggers have been in a situation where your phone is the **only** tool on hand.

One of my favorite tech reviewers has: in Becca Farsace’s review of the Light Phone 3, she finds herself in a situation where she has no idea where she’s supposed to be going for an event and with no way to log in to her email to check, because she has **no way to authenticate** when logging in.

Farsace is blessed with a friend willing to make a phone call(!) to find out the answer, but her temporary solution is to carry **another smart phone** around, leading to a conclusion that the Light Phone 3 is “like a designer bag or a luxury car, because if you own it I’m positive it is not your only phone.”

I’m pretty sure we agreed a long time ago that SMS two-factor authentication is bad, and we should use more advanced methods like email or TOTP. I think we can also agree that getting lost is bad, or that not having access to your calendar for event details when you’re on the road – the best time for a **mobile computer**, is bad. Not having access to email – which for better and worse, is the primary way important, asynchronous information is communicated from a variety of official parties – is bad! Access to any and all of these tools while away from home has been crucial multiple times in my life, or at least convenient and therefore making my life better. Why get rid of them?

The conversation about dumb phones is about **social media**. It throws the baby out with the bath water to get people away from addictive algorithmic platforms, and we can’t discount the bias of people who write about tech, as they’re the most online people. Meanwhile, 15% of U.S. adults [don’t have broadband, but have a phone](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/).

Here’s where I take my turn to be righteous: Using your smart phone for social/algorithmic media, predatory skinner-box games, and generative AI is what **makes** it a dumb phone.

Maximizing its **usefulness**, through great apps and learning its capabilities, is to make it a tool worthy of your energy, time, and trust – a **smart phone**.

But in ourselves, that we are underlings.

And because we [live in a society](https://thenib.com/mister-gotcha/), that does mean giving some of your data to tech giants, unfortunately. Pick your poison and get the most out of it while giving them the least you can, then call your senator if you care about privacy. There’s more you can do, of course, so let’s get practical:

- It’s true, don’t install bad apps. Not only dumb apps, but poorly-made apps from random companies. Be disciplined and figure out if you can use the browser instead, or forego it. You know they harvest your data, and in return for little or nothing.
- Pay for high quality apps from great developers – for emphasis, **pay for great apps**. 
- Also try finding cool apps from open source makers, universities, and researchers. Try using the Wikipedia app instead of searching for things in a browser, for example.
- Get smart. Become a pro user. Learn the settings. If you have older parents who can barely work the thing, teach them next.
- Personalize your phone any way you damn well want. Android is the better OS for customization because you can change the entire paradigm of interaction through custom launchers, but Apple has finally allowed such innovations as negative space on the home page. These are **tools, not traps**.
- Use features like [bedtime schedules](https://support.google.com/android/answer/9887159?hl=en) and [focus modes](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/set-up-a-focus-iphd6288a67f/ios) to set the mood and mode of your phone to match your rhythms. You are the dictator of your time, not the device.
- Don’t get one for your young child. This is the [correct demographic](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/17/cellphone-smartphone-bans-schools) for a flip phone. (Get them an MP01; they’ll probably become an architect.)
- Your phone is **mobile** device, don’t carry it around the house without a reason. Get a dock for it and give it a place away from bed and out of mind but easy to grab on the way out the door.

In step four of her guide, Johnston advocates for having a boring background or none at all: “This is your enemy, not your friend; don't let it wear the skins of your loved ones.” This is the kind of unhinged take from someone who has been too online for too long and has conflated the tool with the platforms they access with it; what used to get them high on Discourse has now become a hellish Palantir. That’s not the phone’s fault, really, and it’s not your fault either – we know who the [real enemy is]({{<relref "/blog/2024-03-28 Dopamine Was Never Enough.md">}}).
