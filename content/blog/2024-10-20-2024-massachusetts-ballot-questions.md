Perhaps you've heard, but there's an election haunting our calendars.  Never mind that in America they haunt our calendars for [far, far too long](https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/10/21/450238156/canadas-11-week-campaign-reminds-us-that-american-elections-are-much-longer), but we all know that only [7 states matter](https://time.com/7009161/battleground-swing-states-2024-election/).

Obviously it's your civic duty to vote, but in certain places it can feel like the presidential vote is decided for your area, and that you're merely contributing to the popular vote score that will be ignored. To stave off the dread, I love learning more about ballot initiatives.

In Massachusetts we're blessed with interesting and complex ballot initiatives – in recent years we've approved better conditions for farm animals, forced companies to give sick time to workers, expanded rights to repair for cars, and much more.

In the past I've felt rewarded for learning more about these issues and posting about them on social media, where friends and family let me know they appreciated the attempt at nuance and accessible information. Well, I don't have any social media anymore, but I can blog whenever I want! This post is for me to learn out loud about the 2024 ballot initiatives for Massachusetts. I'll include my sources, sorted in alphabetical order, and try to write like a normal person.  

Disclaimer: I am not saying I'm an expert on these issues nor am I presenting a perfect, unbiased viewpoint on them! I'm trying to think my way through the ballot initiatives and at least check on different perspectives.

Disclaimer 2: I can't learn about all of these in one day, so I'll keep updating the post as I learn more!

To get started, I went to [Turbovote](https://turbovote.org/) to get caught up on my ballot and the initiatives, then started searching for news stories about each one. I found the Tufts [Center for State Policy Analysis](https://cspa.tufts.edu/2024-ballot-questions) valuable as high-level, plain-language explanations of each side's positions.

This year we have 5 ballot questions, and they're all pretty substantial. Let's dive in.

Update: I didn't get to go as in-depth with each question as I wanted to, in part because my positions became pretty clear and in part because wow it's been a time slogging to the finish line of this election, huh? For posterity and the exercise of thinking out loud I'm recording the thoughts I do have.

## Question 1 – Auditing the state legislature

> Authorize the state auditor to audit the state legislature, and remove some existing regulations regarding the auditing process

- [Auditor authority: How Question 1 seeks to allow state audits of Mass. Legislature | WBUR News](https://www.wbur.org/news/2024/09/20/massachusetts-auditor-dizoglio-beacon-hill-ballot-question-1-explainer)
- [Current, former Mass. state auditors disagree about Question 1](https://www.wcvb.com/article/auditor-question-1-massachusetts-ballot-question/62570072)
- [In Massachusetts, Once A Leader In Government Transparency, Key Votes Are Hidden From The Public](https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickgleason/2022/01/12/in-massachusetts-once-a-model-in-government-transparency-key-votes-are-hidden-from-the-public/)
- [Mass. ballot question 1: Should the state auditor be able to audit the Legislature? – NBC Boston](https://www.nbcboston.com/news/politics/mass-ballot-question-1-state-auditor/3512948/)
- [Open States' Legislative Data Report Card - Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/Open_States%27_Legislative_Data_Report_Card)

According to Ballotpedia's legislative report card, Massachusetts is one of the least transparent legislatures in the country, earning an "F" grade alongside illustrious company such as Alabama, Kentucky, and Nebraska. (To be clear, this is a supra-partisan issue: California and Rhode Island both earned "D" grades.) Our state has a rich history of corruption and scandal that I've only begun to learn about in recent years as our state police constantly [bathes in shit](https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/2024/05/22/after-years-of-scandals-have-the-massachusetts-state-police-turned-a-corner/) and our state government waits until the last minute to [pretend to try to pass anything](https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2024-08-01/mass-lawmakers-adjourn-after-all-night-session-with-a-housing-bill-passed-but-not-much-else).

Looking at specific house committees for example, shows no record of them meeting or planning to meet, such as the [House Committee on Global Warming and Climate Change](https://malegislature.gov/Committees/Detail/H51/About) or [House Committee on Ethics](https://malegislature.gov/Committees/Detail/H38); joint committees on [Public Health](https://malegislature.gov/Committees/Detail/J16/Members) and [Education](https://malegislature.gov/Committees/Detail/J14/Members) haven't met since 2023, per their own records. There might be some good reasons for this, there might not. Let's just say it's not a great look for the state house right now. (To be clear on this tangent, the state auditor could not look into committee assignments, but it's a good example of the lack of transparency.)

Enter Diana DiZoglio, a former state senator and now elected state auditor, who is championing this ballot initiative to give her office the explicit power to audit the Massachusetts legislature. Her zeal is commendable, but I don't love that the ballot initiative is so tightly tied to her – she [ran her campaign](https://www.dianaforma.com/my-audit-plan) on gaining this power and now has to deliver, as opposed to this being something approached only on its merits or the principle of the thing.

Towards the principle of the thing, as WBUR points out, "unlike other ballot initiatives, Question 1 has no registered opponents." It's hard to be against auditing politicians, who we instinctively believe are corrupt and, as mentioned, have a history of corruption. Auditing them can only bring more information to voters to make informed decisions on their representatives.

In response to worries that the state auditor would grow too powerful, and perhaps be another leverage point for corruption, there appear to  safeguards built in: "core legislative functions" (voting, committee assignments) can't be audited, audits can only result in investigations and studies, and the legislature's members can, and in all likelihood will, be assholes about the whole thing, which would reduce the efficacy of the audits happening but expose members for being against audits in the first place, which is itself valuable information.

I personally can't think of any reason to be against someone doing more investigation into politicians at any level, so I'm strongly in favor of this ballot initiative.

## Question 2 – Repealing MCAS requirements for graduating high school

> Repeal the requirement that students must achieve a certain competency level on the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) exam to graduate high school

- [Question 2: The battle over MCAS graduation requirement heats up - Axios Boston](https://www.axios.com/local/boston/2024/08/15/the-battle-over-mcas)
- [MCAS: The debate over Question 2, an effort to drop the high school 'exit exam' | WBUR News](https://www.wbur.org/news/2024/09/20/massachusetts-election-high-school-exam-mcas-ballot-question-2-explainer)
- [High Stakes Testing](https://massteacher.org/current-initiatives/high-stakes-testing)

What do you replace the MCAS requirement with? Surely we don't want students to be able to graduate without question; our great education systems should have benchmarks and paths for remediation built in, right? The Massachusetts Teacher Association (MTA) says this:

> Voting yes won’t eliminate the MCAS test—rather, it will replace the test as a graduation requirement with other measures that more accurately evaluate a student’s mastery of their coursework and state education standards.

However those other measures aren't part of the ballot measure; they would be determined by the state's 300 different educational districts. Not that I don't trust them – again, I'm deeply proud of Massachusetts' school systems, and a proud product of them – but it's worth noting that sometimes large-scale requirements exist for a reason.

Then again, the MCAS one is pretty shit: it's one "high-stakes test" as the MTA puts it, in 10th grade oddly enough, and the amount of prep work and curriculum design that surrounds it is a black hole. Getting rid of the requirement will let districts decide what makes sense for their populations for graduating, but more importantly release all that tension around one day in an educational journey made of over a thousand days. Standardized testing has a lot of evidence against it, and the conversation can't stop here with repealing the requirement.

Lastly, my wife is in the MTA, and they asked their members to vote yes, and that's an endorsement I do put faith in, so we'll be voting yes on this.

## Question 3 – Allowing rideshare drivers to unionize and collectively bargain

> Provide for unionizing and collective bargaining for transportation network drivers

- [What to know about Question 3 on the Mass. ballot](https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2024/09/20/massachusetts-ballot-question-3-rideshare-drivers-unions/)
- [Ride-hailing unions: How Question 3 aims to allow Uber and Lyft drivers to unionize | WBUR News](https://www.wbur.org/news/2024/09/20/massachusetts-election-transportation-union-uber-lyft-ballot-question-3-explainer)
- [Healey opposes ballot questions on tipped wage increase, MCAS grad requirement | GBH](https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2024-10-16/healey-opposes-ballot-questions-on-tipped-wage-increase-mcas-grad-requirement)
- [MA Ballot Question 3: Should Uber/Lyft drivers be allowed to unionize?](https://www.telegram.com/story/news/politics/elections/state/2024/09/19/massachusetts-ballot-question-three-allow-unions-uber-lyft-drivers-transportation-network-companies/75290319007/)
- [What to know about Question 3 on the Mass. ballot](https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2024/09/20/massachusetts-ballot-question-3-rideshare-drivers-unions/)

I didn't love seeing ads from Uber and Lyft for the past few months in the Axios Boston newsletter about how these rideshare companies supposedly let people bootstrap their way to happiness, like they enjoy some miraculous working arrangement and not a tense, exploitative one that "disrupted" the regulated taxi business for few good reasons.

This vote doesn't guarantee those drivers a union, and it doesn't guarantee them protection from the fuckery of these fuckery-notorious companies; it gives them the option to start the process of taking back their power. Obvious yes to this one.

## Question 4 – Allowing growing and possession of psychedelics

> Allow persons 21 years of age or older to grow, possess, and use natural psychedelic substances, as well as establish a commission to regulate the licensing of psychedelic substances and services

- [Psychedelics, MCAS, Rideshare Unions, and More: What You Need to Know about This Year’s Ballot Questions | BU Today | Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/articles/2024/what-to-know-about-this-years-ballot-questions/)
- [Psychedelics: How Question 4 could legalize the drugs for therapeutic use in Mass. | WBUR News](https://www.wbur.org/news/2024/09/20/massachusetts-election-psychedelic-mushrooms-ballot-question-4-explainer)
- [Massachusetts Question 4 on Psychedelics: What to Know](https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2024/09/26/question-4-ballot-psychedelics/)

I'm broadly in favor of legalizing, regulating, and taxing the hell out of drugs; there's evidence to support that it's a healthier way for a society to handle its civilization-age relationships with vices. No one should go to jail for using a natural substance, and a gentle hand towards research and medicinal and therapeutic use, which for psychedelics in particular is a strong use case, seems worthwhile. We had this talk about marijuana, and the worst thing to come from that has been tacky shops with bad branding, no worse than any packy.

## Question 5 – Increase minimum wage for tipped employees

> Increase the minimum wage for tipped employees to meet the state's standard minimum wage

- [Good or bad for business? Arguments for, against Question 5](https://www.wcvb.com/article/question-5-massachusetts-arguments/62627586)
- [Massachusetts tipping point: Boston restaurant workers sound off on Question 5](https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/10/10/massachusetts-tipping-point-restaurant-workers-from-boston-elsewhere-sound-off-on-question-5/)
- [MA ballot Question 5: Both sides debate the tipped worker issue](https://www.capecodtimes.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/18/massachusetts-debate-ballot-question-on-tipped-worker-wages/75700590007/)

This one is a lot thornier than I thought it would be, because it's at the intersection of main-street economics and class warfare. I'm not pretending I know anything about the service industry; I went into retail as a teen because I knew I'd drop shit and freak out taking orders. The most I know is from [*Writers & Lovers* by Lily King](https://lilykingbooks.com/writers-lovers).

The sub-minimum wage for workers is an affront on its face, but some data claims the current "solution" as it is working:

> Based on a survey of 351 servers, bartenders, and other tipped staff conducted last February, Carnegie Mellon University found that 86% of respondents said the current tipping system works well for them. Roughly 89% said they earn at least $20 per hour and 56% reported taking in more than $30 an hour.

The restaurant owners complain that they'll have to implement higher menu prices and service charges to cover the increase in labor costs. While my gut reaction is to shout ["*Then the business should not exist!*"](https://youtu.be/rEQhA-JJlH0?feature=shared), it's also true that inflation has drive up the cost of everything, including what the Bureau of Labor Statistics calls "food away from home", which has risen 3.9% [in 2024](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm). In other words, I'm genuinely worried that service charges and even more expensive food *will* kill the small town restaurants I adore in central Massachusetts.

The initiative wouldn't end tipping culture, it'd still be there. What if costs go up for businesses, which are passed onto the diner, *and* I'm expected to leave a good tip, does that mean dinner now costs $150 for two? If it does, I won't be going out often, which negatively affects those workers too as the restaurants close and they're out of a job.

Then again, leaving the institution of tipping as the subsidized, unequal form of pay feels terrible. It doesn't help that this has only been done in one other place, [Washington D.C.](https://www.marketplace.org/2024/04/12/washington-d-c-is-a-test-case-for-phasing-out-the-tipped-minimum-wage/), where employment went down and prices went up, but the number of restaurants continues to grow – what gives? This isn't a solved problem by any means. One way to think of implementing the proper minimum wage is a shift towards more stable, averaged-out wages for all – some people will lose, but others will gain important predictability.

Honestly, I'll be thinking about this one down to the wire.
