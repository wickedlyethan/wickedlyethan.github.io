I haven't played many games this year, and I haven't loved most of what I've played. Same with 2023, same with 2022. There are gems, and I'm not saying that good games aren't being made or don't exist – that's statistically impossible given the sheer amount that are being released. What I'm noticing is personal. The biggest genres of the moment – "live-service" games, horror, *Souls*-likes, sports games – aren't my thing, and the games I am playing aren't connecting the way they used to.

Gone are the days of playing 30, 40 games a year and keeping a spreadsheet of hours played, thoughts and feelings, and academic observations. Now I keep a humble text document and scratch in some thoughts when something good comes along, but nothing serious. The games section of my usual "media of the year" posts are getting harder to write – [last year]() I moved it to the bottom of the post and admitted I didn't finish *Baldur's Gate 3* and had mixed feelings about *Counter-Strike 2*.

And then [*Echo Point Nova*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1836730/Echo_Point_Nova/) happened.

I'm too young for boomer shooters, and I find their obsession with gore and giblets a bit puerile; *Call of Duty* stopped being a mainstay for me after *Modern Warfare 2* – the FIRST ONE. I was raised on movement shooters: *Tribes Vengeance*, *F.E.A.R.*, *Unreal Tournament 2004*. I love 3D games that are about novel forms of movement: [*Refunct*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/406150/Refunct/), the *Just Cause* games, *Titanfall 2*, [*A Story About My Uncle*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/278360/A_Story_About_My_Uncle/), *Mirror's Edge* and its sequel, and 2D platformers like both *Ori* games and [*Yoku's Island Express*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/334940/Yokus_Island_Express/) are all-time favorites. (*Apex Legends* held my interest with these mechanics for a long time until it became a garish, high-risk time-sink.)

Movement is to games what editing is to film – it's the special feature that no other medium has. Moving through space in novel, impossible ways – or moving mundanely through novel, impossible spaces – is unique to video games and for me is addictive and awe-inspiring.

Which brings me back to *Echo Point Nova*: this game is absolutely incredible. It perfectly blends the best first-person movement mechanics – grapple hooks, double jumps, air control, ground pounds, frictionless skiing – with satisfying, precise shooting in a huge open world populated with designed arenas. It's the movement shooters of yore mixed with [*The Signal from Tolva*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/457760/The_Signal_From_Tlva/) and [*SUPERHOT*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322500/SUPERHOT/), and it's addictive and satisfying and brilliant. My friend nathan and I tried to savor our co-op playthrough it in chunks, but in between sessions we'd just talk more about how freaking good it was and how we wish we were playing. This is a game that feels like it was made for me and my gaming skillset, like every other game like it was building to *Echo Point Nova*.

I could write a thousand words about it, but I also can't. It's a game about kinaesthetics – "game feel" – and it can't be communicated how sick it is to play without *playing* it. If it at all sounds like your jam, buy it.

That's not the problem. The problem is that *Echo Point Nova* is so good that it makes me not want to bother playing other games.

When I was younger, I'd get grouchy with my dad for putting on the same Grateful Dead and Lori McKenna albums "over and over again"; we all know that the music we listened to when we were younger helped define us and can be a comfortable rut to fall back into. Same with movies, books, and, I think now, games. There's all sorts of reasons for this – fear of the unknown, shrinking leisure time – and it's not ground-breaking to say, but I've never felt it acutely before. *Unless someone makes a game that reminds me of the games I used to play, I think I'm all good.*

Games are too long, too involved, too resource-intensive for what little I feel like I'm getting out of them. (Don't even get me started on their misguided narrative bloat, that's a different blog post.) Unless it's *Echo Point Nova*, in which case holy shit I might start it all over again. Otherwise I'm in a chapter where emulating the games I loved (and the ones I missed) is more enticing than investing in the state-of-the-art, or sifting the soil for gold.

*P.S.* You know what game I've played the most lately? *Golf With Your Friends*, just as something to click around in while we chat. I'm hoping it and games like [*WEBFISHING*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3146520/WEBFISHING/) and the upcoming [*Big Walk*](https://bigwalk.game/) by House House become the beginning of a genre Ana Diaz for Polygon calls [yapping games](https://www.polygon.com/gaming/468027/webfishing-online-chat-room-game) – it's something to do while you hang out with friends remotely that isn't competitive or cognitive overload. Give us small worlds to be in and vibe.
