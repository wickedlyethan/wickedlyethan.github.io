Just got back from [*Iron Lung*](https://letterboxd.com/film/iron-lung/) and I loved it. Every critique of it is accurate – it’s overly long and its exposition vs mystery is not perfectly balanced – but it’s wonderful to see something made with love and passion that is, to be reductive, “so different” from most things in theaters of late.[^1] 

*Iron Lung* is a miracle of low-budget filmmaking. The low-light, dingy cinematography; utterly crucial and unnerving sound design; wet, sharp, production design; and considered but nasty special effects are punching so far above their class as to be a near complete illusion. They put the freaking set on [hydraulic stilts](https://youtu.be/WcJWymZ1x9o?si=J2C5cyudrKqSpHCZ) like *Inception* and ambition like that is, in and of itself, thrilling and commendable. Knowing almost nothing about Markiplier other than his fervor for making this film[^2], it’s hard not to root for the theatrical underdog, and I think he’s earned it. 

Shit like putting your set on stilts and throwing your star around was only possible because *Iron Lung* is another entry is the venerable single-location sci-fi story. [*Moon* (2009)](https://letterboxd.com/film/moon/), [*Coherence* (2013)](https://letterboxd.com/film/coherence/), [*Snowpiercer* (2013)](https://letterboxd.com/film/snowpiercer/), [*Ex Machina* (2015)](https://letterboxd.com/film/ex-machina-2015/), [*10 Cloverfield Lane* (2016)](https://letterboxd.com/film/10-cloverfield-lane/) all leverage their limited locales to great effect. It’s an economical choice that plays well into the principled introspection of good science fiction. If fantasy is history, sci-fi is philosophy, that kind of thing. This time there’s buckets of blood to go with it. 

Funnily enough, this isn’t the first time a YouTuber has done this sort of thing. Ashley Clements, star of the innovative and really charming [*The Lizzie Bennet Diaries*](https://www.youtube.com/@LizzieBennet),  kickstarted an ultra low-budget webseries and built an [escape pod in her living room](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ashleyclements/sona-finishing-funds/description) with her husband. [*Sona* (2019)](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjsmrZT6f9QcZqgZQHkxMHzZA-HOG-dv2&si=w2zgvKr1CG7mK3gR) is as scrappy as it gets, and having not watched it since the crowdfunding I’m not going to unequivocally vouch for it, but I remember watching it back then and having the similar feeling of parasocial pride and inspiration from the sheer audacity to make something when you have, definitionally, none of the resources some might say you need.

Specificity becomes the filmmaker’s friend and the writer’s joy. All the above works are *weird* and we adore weird. Per Chuck Wendig’s [review](https://terribleminds.com/ramble/2026/02/02/iron-lung-what-a-very-good-very-weird-thing/) of *Iron Lung* and cheerleading of The Process:

> You’re just like the convict in the movie — welded into a box for two hours, given little clue or context, good luck, it’s gonna get weird down there in the blood-dark tides.

[^1]: I’m not caught up on the Fangoria-core indie horror scene, I’d say my movie taste has evolved into “blockbuster basic bitch” in a lot of ways.

[^2]: Ages ago, one of my first years as a PAX East volunteer, Markiplier showed up on the show floor unannounced and caused a security and crowd control nightmare. At the time we assumed it was because he was an arrogant jerk, but maybe [Hanlon’s razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor) came into play that one time almost 10 years ago, so it’s a fun story to tell separate from Mark Fischbach, whose movie I really liked.
