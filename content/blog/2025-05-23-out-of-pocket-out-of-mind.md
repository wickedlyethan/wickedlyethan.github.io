Mozilla continues to flail, and yesterday announced it’s shutting down [Pocket](https://www.theverge.com/news/672924/mozilla-pocket-fakespot-shutting-down), which used to be the premier “read it later” app until it was infected with low-quality sponsored content and became a bloated mess. There’s a lot to be written about building sustainable businesses out of web utilities, enshittification, etc., but what struck me when reading the announcement was how much less of the internet I sit down and read nowadays.

From 2015 to 2021 I was in the top 1% of Pocket users, reading (by their measure) between 1.1 and 3.9 **million** words a year on whatever cheap tablet I could get my hands on.

I was in college, passionate about game design and a heyday of game criticism; there were fantastic sites like *The Awl*, *The Outline*, *The Establishment*, and *The Toast* pumping out good reads; Medium was novel and good; TinyLetter preceded Substack and was weirder and wilder; the incessant paywalls hadn’t gone up on legacy media like *The Atlantic* and the *New York Times*.

In 2021 something changed, and I found a draft of a blog post thinking about it when I got my year in review email:

> But something was off. I was in the top 5% of readers, but I had read only 228,000 words in the app, which itself is a **87% drop** year-over-year, and 2020 before it was a 53% drop from 2019. Assuming there hasn't been an exodus of users from Pocket, it would appear that everyone is reading less """content""", and I personally a *lot* less.

Because I switched apps I can’t offer objective measurements, but I know intuitively I’ve read less and less internet since then, what I called the “fevered, diseased highs of constant consumption leading up to the 2020 election”. Luckily this isn’t a post-COVID “I can’t believe I can’t read any more” thing. I’m reading plenty, but not here. In addition to good websites being bought by [content ghouls](https://aftermath.site/polygon-layoffs-sale) as the ad-based internet continues to collapse in favor of social media (gross) or patronage models (wonderful but limited and self-limiting – I can’t subscribe to everything), something ineffable has changed about what I *do* read from the internet.

My favorite newsletters are, to be blunt, smart people telling me how terrible the world is right now. With no social media, the places I scroll for “raw” feeds of content, Pinboard’s [popular page](https://pinboard.in/popular) and Bear Blog’s [discover feed](https://bearblog.dev/discover/) yield gold nuggets sometimes, but by volume are posts navel-gazing about the internet itself. (He said while writing an article about the internet.) Reddit, the drug I’m weaning myself from, is garbage-tier screenshots of tweets *still*. The supply is infinite low-quality junk food, but I’ve taken a decade to shift my diet to smaller meals full of vegetables (high quality magazine writing) and fruits (novels), stuff that came from the ground (teams of smart professional writers).

Am I saying that kind of reading is objectively better than what I used to save to Pocket, or what Pocket wanted me to read for the past few years? Yes, I think I am. My year in review from Pocket for 2019 says I read as many words as **53 books**. I wish I had done that instead back then, but I’m closer to doing that this year than any other.
