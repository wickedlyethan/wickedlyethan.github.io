No introduction needed! These are the albums and songs I loved this year.

## The Summer of Pop

As we barreled towards the future there was something intensely fun about a summer of excellent pop music. Chappell Roan's meteoric rise alongside Sabrina Carpenter's overdue recognition brought fun, playful horniness to the front of the pop culture landscape; Meghan Trainor  modernized her sound and Charli XCX continued to temper hers; there was always something loud and fun to put on in the car and make everything feel like a party.

Three of the above artists released their sixth albums while the world retro-actively learned about Roan's barn-burner of a first album, which is an interesting dynamic – everyone's trying to change to figure out what the future is, but Chappell was right there under our noses. Having no new Carly Rae Jepsen or Hannah Diamond this year, it felt like a year of watching the guard change – I haven't been "into" a Taylor Swift release in *10 years* – and everyone getting a bit weirder, a bit more into themselves in the right way; diversification to survive.

(Shout-out in particular to Carpenter's gnarly, homage-filled music video for "Taste", and her BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge performance of ["Good Luck Babe!"](https://youtu.be/io0UQ74sXfw?feature=shared))

My favorite tracks:

- "Taste", Sabrina Carpenter
- "Von Dutch", Charli XCX
- "Femininomenon", Chappell Roan
- "To the Moon", Meghan Trainor

## *Audio Vertigo* by Elbow

There's no world in which a new Elbow release isn't one of my favorite albums of the year. Three years after *Flying Dreams 1*, an album made of the most pleasant, delicate, and heart-tugging side of Elbow, they show up with a big-room tight-groove rock album exchanging the handkerchief for the cricket bat. Leader [Guy Garvey says](https://www.undertheradarmag.com/interviews/elbow_guy_garvey_on_their_10th_album_audio_vertigo) they let longtime drummer Alex Reeves have more creative input this time – "that gave us a real taste of playing as a real band again" – and you can feel it from the first seconds of every track. The whole tracklist has my head bobbing from start to finish, and the grooves are driving, slippery, and textured all at the same time – it's intense to see a rhythm section come to the fore of a band that makes sonic poetry its calling card; these stanzas have a steam locomotive behind them.

Speaking of those stanzas, its not like Guy Garvey can't write incredibly. From the earth-shaking, head-spinning, my favorite track, ["Balu"](https://youtu.be/_trbjdRyI80?feature=shared):

> You carried me over the threshold\
You were the B of the bang of the binge\
'Til I split for a tryst with a rust belt girl with a Plantagenet fringe\
And, oh, do I miss you Balu with your bookmark heart\
And your bible of Sign o' the Times\
I'll dig you back up when they kill you\
And hollow your skull for my wine\
Balu, Balu, Balu

No one else writes lyrics like this!! It keeps me coming back to every Elbow release over and over again.

## "JUPiTER" by Coldplay

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/07Pmjxhuo4k?si=1II2vTi6a02uI4cl" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Similarly to TSwift, Coldplay misses for me more often than they hit nowadays; *Moon Music* is mostly over-produced, over-featured treacle with barely a recognizable band underneath it. "JUPiTER" isn't *not* treacle-y, but it's also beautiful, heartwarming, and builds in a triumphant way that works with its direct, uncomplicated story of self-actualization and love. I love the call and response of "I love who I love", and the *Viva la Vida* strings.

> Jupiter, named for a planet, wasn't free to be\
To be exactly who she ought to be\
She saw in colours others couldn't see\
Jupiter, named for a planet, we pretend to be\
Somebody way less extraordinary\
"Sometimes I wonder what is wrong with me"

## "Sophie's House" by half•alive

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ukcrlVnsAvM?si=CsapA4PNmFMLd_9Z" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

*Persona* is a good album, full of good grooves and half•alive's understated but big feelings, but "Sophie's House" is the first track and caught me off guard. It's the year of the shout-singing I think, and this chorus beats them all. This song is an 80's adventure movie on DVD, it's a board game on the porch well after the sun has gone down, it's hanging out lake-side thinking you're being deep. It's looking back at those times with melancholy, trying to give your past self some grace.

> Times are a changin'\
I, I, I\
Don't wanna waste it\
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why \
Am I stuck here dreaming? Scratching at the ceiling\
Why, tell me why, tell me why\
Do I chase the feeling? Wish that I could see\
I'm having the time of my life

## *Don't Forget Me* by Maggie Rogers

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JHh3w5xgSkc?si=xJN5-5aCi_7NTdun" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

On first listen Maggie Rogers' latest almost seems like easy listening – there's great groove pushing along nice washes of strings and synths in the opening "It Was Coming All Along", and many of the other tracks are precise and matter-of-fact in an approachable way. Tune into those damnable lyrics and you find that Rogers is singing the blues, and there's a profound ache to the temporary nature of, well, everything.

From "On & On & On":

> You understated, overrated\
You were making space for your hunger\
You celebrated all your ways\
Oh, I should've heard the thunder

From "Never Going Home":

> I can't behave\
But I don't wanna be alone, but\
You kept me waiting\
Now I'm never, ever going home

By the time you're through you're nervously thinking well that was lovely, then the devastating eponymous final track hits you and you're crying in the car. Another shout-sing chorus for the ages:

> So close the door and change the channel\
Give me something I can handle\
A good lover, someone who's nice to me\
Take my money, wreck my Sundays\
Love me 'til your next somebody\
Oh, but promise me that when it's time to leave\
Oh, won't you promise me that when it's time to leave\
Don't forget me\
Don't forget me

## What I forgot in 2023

I remember choosing not to write about my favorite music of 2023 for two reasons: my usual format of one-big-post was growing unwieldy, and I felt like I didn't have anything to say other than "thank goodness".

Thank goodness for [*Celebrants* by Nickel Creek](https://nickelcreek.bandcamp.com/album/celebrants), [*Stand in the Joy* by William Prince](https://williamprince.bandcamp.com/album/stand-in-the-joy), and [*Perfect Picture* by Hannah Diamond](https://hannahdiamond.bandcamp.com/album/perfect-picture). I needed those albums when they came out, and I'm not sure what else to say about them.
