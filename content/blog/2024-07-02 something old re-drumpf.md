Today I'm re-publishing a piece I wrote for a web-zine I published with my amazing friend Shea back in the spring of 2016 called *Anyways Magazine*. It was spurred by the bleakness of the Vox piece ["The rise of American authoritarianism"](https://www.vox.com/2016/3/1/11127424/trump-authoritarianism) by Amanda Taub, which elucidated survey data going all the way back to 1992 in which it became very clear that a sizable and growing group of Americans **want** authoritarianism. I was a 22-year-old sophomore in college and I felt darkness on the horizon, so I wrote a snarky satirical listicle because that's all I thought I could do[^1].

It's quaint and painfully naive now at best, but I'd like to point I was talking about fleeing America *before it was cool*. It's worth noting that even at the time I knew that emigration was a non-starter – the world has calcified. After a truly horrific week of news from SCOTUS I'm posting this because it does a feel a bit prescient, I guess.

I've lightly edited the piece to avoid embarrassing myself 10 years later, and added footnotes for additional commentary.

The political landscape of America has spent the last couple of years steadily, assuredly burning itself to the ground – razing all reason and blocking out the average citizen to have any impact in the larger workings of the political machine outside of their Facebook feed. We are so saturated with our daily dose of doom that many have simply become complacent in its place in our society, and our place within it. And yet now we see the [methodical](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/10/white-man-pathology-bernie-sanders-donald-trump), [mappable](http://www.vox.com/2016/3/1/11127424/trump-authoritarianism) rise of the tyrant-clown that is Donald J. Trump, the banner for quite literally every symptom of what is going wrong as we watch, and fling jokes from behind our creaking shields; at some point, something's gotta give.

As a “disaffected [pesky whipper-snapper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/millennials-begone/dlgjecnejicmpdknhangcbeahbgipolf?hl=en)", I'm full of all kinds of future-anxiety; my prolepsis attacks are well-shot, well-directed, 4k nightmares. I've taken the time to map some conclusions, as has [everyone else](https://youtu.be/dgGLq5nSTEg)[^2] on the internet, and it's time to take action – so let's make a listicle! Let's check out the **top four places to flee to when America, inevitably, begins to burn**:

## 4: Canada

The best option for the less brave of us who still want to be nearby enough that they can drive over the border and visit, like taking a trip to the zoo. The health care is wonderful, the president is weirdly attractive, and everyone apologizes a lot, which is humbling. French slips into your vernacular and you again “a-gain” after a while; Dunkin' Donuts is replaced with Tim Horton's. You mostly wear fashionable parkas. It's all familiar, like someone scraped too little New England over too much tundra.

*If anything what's most frightening about the Trump fiasco is the sheer number of rational voices that have risen up against the man, to no avail. All the important celebrity figureheads, pundits, and politicians have called for the man's ideological head, and it seems to have effected absolutely nothing. Arguably the problem with John Oliver doing a tear-down of the orange-haired troll doll is that only people who already watch John Oliver will see it; same with Trevor Noah, Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers, etc. The sanity is in an echo-chamber on the coasts, lacking penetrating power into the thick red blood of the middle of the country.[^3]*

## 3: Iceland

Once you can get past the smidge of a language barrier, you find there are no mosquitoes, more books per capita than in any other country, and hot springs. Your inevitably beautiful children will be smarter than you. The tradition is to give books on Christmas Eve, then end the party early so everyone can bundle up and read; as you cuddle and watch an aurora borealis appear in the infinite blackness above, you'll idly speculate when the nearest volcano will explode, and find it more poetic than tragic. Everything is incredibly well designed. You still can't speak Icelandic. You invest in a UV lamp. You invest in many UV lamps. The cold is your biggest worry. That, and speaking Icelandic. *Af gódu upphafi vonast góður endir.*[^4]

*I have no allegiance to America as a philosophical construct, never mind a physical thing: when I walk the streets of my hometown it's not "America", it's a town in a state in a region, and from there Google Maps stops loading and I just close the tab. I never said the pledge of allegiance in school; it reminded me of the eye on the pyramid on the back of one-dollar bills, and later it was my smallest act of nihilistic anti-camouflage. Having been to other parts of the world and even the other side of the country, it is still impossible to consider "this land" in all its magnitude and variety with any kind of tangibility, nevermind reverence or dogma. When crusaders reply with arguments about how lucky we are to have free speech for example, I point out we're not the only country with it; others pay less for it too. When free speech can be ranked by a third-rate website, it's no longer [a blessed commodity](http://www.therichest.com/rich-list/10-countries-with-the-most-freedom-of-speech/?view=all). I can't think of anything we have that other countries don't that are actual [good things](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-34996604).*[^5]

## 2: Uruguay

You didn't even know Uruguay existed until that Buzzfeed[^6] article that listed [21](http://www.buzzfeed.com/conzpreti/reasons-why-you-need-to-move-to-uruguay-in-2014#.bx1zVWG3P) intelligent, well-articulated reasons you needed to go; suddenly this little South American democracy became the beacon for liberal co-eds[^7] Internet-wide, and who doesn't want in on that? Your high-school Spanish classes finally came in handy as you burnt both side of the candle night after night in Punta del Este, giving yourself fully to a whole new world you never thought you'd know. When your parents call, worried and wondering when you'll come home, you have to work hard to remember to use slower, deliberate English, even as your temper rises whenever they ask: “is this really what you want?”

*A guilty side of me points out that if/when the proverbial drains scab over, most of the bad stuff probably won't pertain to me because of my race, gender, or lack of religion; however it will all affect my life as a twenty-something trying to begin a life in a country that [actively hates students](https://youtu.be/P8pjd1QEA0c) and certainly doesn't give a damn [about artists](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/enemies-of-the-arts-19951019).[^8]*

*And there's something to be said for just not wanting to fight all the time with these things, for not suffering an interminable, toxic election cycle or daily school shootings or slavish adherence to ideas that never existed. The fact that not wanting those things will get you called weak, complainer, or unpatriotic seems strange, a bit cro-magnon, but you feel it coming – spooky action at a distance.*

## 1: New Zealand

Your friends all made fun of you for moving all the way across the globe, but really this has been the dream all your life – you saw *Lord* *of the Rings* and suddenly everything changed; this always seemed like the most logical course of action. You move into a trendy closet in Wellington, and knock on the door of WETA every three days. There are sheep everywhere, but the good kind. The coffee is really, really fucking good. There are beaches, mountains, rolling hills, and aggressively attractive young people with wicked accents all within driving distance. While standing on the sharp rocks off [State Highway 1](https://www.google.com/maps/@-42.4499689,173.5768686,3a,75y,217.1h,71.42t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1shivN5H4vFjBoLMmtOwuZNg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656), watching thousands of seals imprint the sands, you think about just how old the world is, and how mother nature doesn't give a shit about electoral colleges or textbook prices. Sometimes you get just the smallest bit nostalgic for home – until you look up airline prices, and nostalgia becomes sticker shock, which in turn becomes sheer giddy content at your isolation. You make a habit out of never checking in on what the rest of the world is doing, and slowly forget that you're a part of it, and therein lies the most total relaxation you could ever know[^9].

[^1]: I included "Drumpf" in the title of this piece at the time because 1) it was oh-so-funny to capital-L Liberal comedians like Stephen Colbert that I watched uncritically at the time, and because someone had made a game called "Drumpf" where you shot physically-simulated dildos at a low-poly caricature of Trump and we all loved it. That game appears to not exist any more, but this Yahoo News article does, so you can still [behold it](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/hurl-dildos-donald-trumps-face-132400312.html).

[^2]: This link is broken, because of course it is, but I bet it was very funny and clever.

[^3]: Pretty upsetting that I only cited comedians as "voices of reason", but that's both a reflection of the country we live in and my political naiveté. It's true that Jon Stewart frequently says things I agree with, in funny ways no less, but I had no idea there were these people called "activists" and "community organizers".

[^4]: This translates to "from a good beginning we hope for a good end", which is achingly poetic and I have no idea how I sourced it – I take no credit.

[^5]: I'm not sure freedom of speech was the one to go after here, considering we do have a pretty robust first amendment compared to other large  (for now), but the point about stats has only gotten worse. Infant and maternal mortality come to mind, but that's recency bias much as my thinking about gun violence was – 2016 has its [own wikipedia index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:2016_mass_shootings_in_the_United_States) for mass shootings in the US.

[^6]: My ire for Buzzfeed and listicles is misplaced. Said listicles paid for [Buzzfeed News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BuzzFeed_News#), a truly great news organization that shut down last year.

[^7]: What the fuck, dude? Who says "co-eds", did I think that was smart-sounding or something?

[^8]: I'll admit I edited this section down as it was painfully naive and limited in scope bordering on insensitive. I barely knew anything about *Roe v Wade* or DACA or HRT or anything really, so I couldn't imagine the kinds of hurt that would come to most people who weren't me.

[^9]: I could write a lot about why this is the incorrect conclusion to make, and the most obvious one that a college sophomore would make, but suffice to say [I do not endorse this worldview](https://lyz.substack.com/p/no-one-is-coming-to-save-us), even as I understand its underlying yearning for some god-damn peace and quiet.
