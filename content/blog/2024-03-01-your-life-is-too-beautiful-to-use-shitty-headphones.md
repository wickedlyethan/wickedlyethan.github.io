The average person listens to between two and four hours of music a day. Then there's podcasts and audiobooks, YouTube videos, phone calls - we listen to so much stuff all the time, yet most people simply don't care about *how* they listen to stuff and that makes me sad.

Wired earbuds [returned for a moment in 2021](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/wired-headphones-2021-it-accessory) so TikTok makers could whisper dramatically into the in-line microphone, but this one random report points to the ["true wireless stereo earbuds market"](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/09/29/2525211/0/en/The-Global-True-Wireless-Stereo-Earbuds-Market-size-is-expected-to-reach-243-9-billion-by-2028-rising-at-a-market-growth-of-34-6-CAGR-during-the-forecast-period.html) reaching $243.9 **billion** by 2028, while Apple alone reportedly sold [90 million pairs](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/03/apple-airpods-business-grew-like-gangbusters-over-the-holidays.html) of airpods in the holiday quarter of 2021. 

And they suck! They do! Most wireless earbuds don't sound great! Putting aside that they make you look like a bit of a douchebag and are [disastrous for the environment](https://www.vice.com/en/article/neae8z/why-airpods-are-a-social-and-environmental-disaster), they simply aren't that good at the main thing they do - deliver high quality audio to your ears.

Think of getting better headphones like investing in car mats - they might not be a "sexy" purchase to you, but they will make your life better and you'll use them everyday. By investing in any decent pair of wired headphones you'll hear your music in new and beautiful ways, reduce ear fatigue, and find a cool new way to express your relationship with all the aural delights the world has on offer. What follows are my recommendations for headphones everyone should consider owning.

## Koss Supremacy

The [Koss KPH-30i](https://koss.com/products/kph30i) are my favorite headphones, period, beating out the still-great [Sony MDR-ZX110s](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/headphones/headband/p/mdrzx110-blk) I have been recommending for more than a decade. They don't have the aggressively 80s construction of the Koss Porta Pros, but they retain a charming retro vibe and are light enough you forget you're wearing them - they perch on your head and cover your ears but aren't closed-back so you can hear the world around you, which reduces listening fatigue while sounding spacious and crisp. These should be everyone's default, straight-up. Every company should hand these out for anyone engaging with Zoom meetings at the least.

(They're also moddable - by swapping out the default earpads for [comfier](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MQVHX84) or [bigger](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071VXQNR9) pads, you can deepen the soundstage substantially, making them sound even more premium. I've done both to different pairs and they beat $300 headphones by huge margins. If you're extremely cool there's even Koss' [utility version](https://koss.com/collections/utility-series/products/kph40-utility), which have an all-metal construction, so you're wearing even less and you can swap cables.)

## Remember Earbuds?

Do you like shoving something into your ear canal, for some reason? No, I don't think you do, actually. It's uncomfortable for long periods of time, the tips get gross, and the noise isolation on any model you're probably buying isn't enough. We refer to these as "earbuds" colloquially, but they're aping in-ear monitors used by professional musicians without any of the benefits. Proper earbuds sit in your outer ear â€“ Airpods do this, but Airpods Max don't, as point of comparison.

Honestly the aforementioned trendy [Apple Earpods](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMTN2AM/A/earpods-lightning-connector) aren't the worst, and it's worth noting that they can be bought with Lightning, USB-C, or 3.5mm connections to avoid adapters if you know what you're going to be plugging into. For $19, not bad!

You'll need to dig if you want something that's not Apple but follows the outer-ear earbud paradigm, but there are options! Convenience store standbys JVC still make a $10 set of [Earpod-a-likes](https://www.jvc.com/usa/headphones/wired-earbuds/ha-f17m/) and Sony's [last model](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/headphones/in-ear/p/mdre9lp-blk) can still be found. 

Then you can get into the beautiful, weird world of Chinese hi-fi brands, who are essentially throwing together old parts from bins in the Shenzen electronics markets and making surprisingly good stuff. Here Reddit is your friend, if you can stomach it, but my pair of [FAAEAL Snow-Lotus](https://www.amazon.com/FAAEAL-Snow-lotus-Earphone-Quality-Earphones/dp/B07BQ1KJNJ?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1) earbuds became an instant favorite the second I tried them out. They're clear, full, and don't hurt like a motherfucker after a few video calls. I wear them out for walks, bring them to the library when I want to pack as light as possible, and take calls with them while doing chores.

## The Big Guns

To be honest, the above options are great for shorter periods of listening or specific use cases like travel and video calls. Do you need people to fuck off and leave you alone? Are you chained to your desk most of the day like most of us? Bring out the big guns - proper over-ear headphones provide real isolation and even bigger drivers for higher quality and are a whole beautiful world of comfort and style.

The watchword nowadays is "active noise cancellation", but some people (like myself) can't use it because of the perceived inner ear pressure that comes from the technique of generating sound waves that cancel out noise, and ANC requires power and power means batteries. You also probably don't need ANC, so skip it.

Instead you can invest anywhere along a spectrum of $50 to $500 and find a dazzling array of headphones, because fundamentally nothing has changed about wired headphones in decades and that's their strength. Shitty premium true wireless earbuds or headphones cost either $20 or $400 and will die and/or become obsolete, but great headphones from thirty years ago are great headphones today and will work with anything with a headphone jack.

Any wired set by [Sennheiser](https://www.sennheiser-hearing.com/en-US/headphones/) will be an excellent stalwart companion, or you could go for the movie-set [Sony classics](https://pro.sony/ue_US/products/headphones/mdr-7506). The trick here is that there are tons of really low-quality wired headphones, almost all of them made by gaming companies who cater to gaudy aesthetics, ludicrous "features", and the need to have a bad microphone to get toxic with every Tuesday night. So don't buy those!

## Conclusion

Really, I'm begging you at this point. You probably love music, or the sound of people's voices, or the white noise we sometimes need to forget the world we live in, and I think you want to hear it as best you can. If you're using trendy wireless earbuds or the headset your work gave you for customer service calls, you're looking through the world with grey-tinted glasses, missing out on texture, space, power and more in everything we listen to. You might get migraines or have sore ears or not care what you're listening to as long as there's something on. I know there's a lot else going on, but I'm blaming your shitty headphones.
