Robert Eggers' latest, *Nosferatu*, is masterfully made and a worthy update to the 1922 film of the same name, but it didn't do a lot for me and I think I know why – it's not my favorite flavor of vampire.

Eggers' first two films – *The Witch* (2015) (an all-time favorite) and *The Lighthouse* (2019) – felt like I was seeing and hearing things I never had before, which was part of the horror and the arthouse feel that elevated both movies. On the other hand, not only is *Nosferatu* straight-forwardly a remake of his childhood obsession, the 1922 film, but its interest is in refinement and its greatest strength is updating the classic tale for a more modern audience while feeling "authentic" with its incredible production design and cinematography. It's not re-framing or re-interpreting the classic material; you could argue this is the most successful "remake" possible, and if you haven't engaged with the original Dracula tale this is the best way to do so, and will become a great introductory piece for the future. (It's more engaging than Coppola's decadent but clunky *Bram Stoker's Dracula* (1992), that's for sure.)

Vampires, like every other creature of modern mythology, are symbols and metaphors, and the time in which any version of them is conjured reflects what is most horrific to the audience at that time. Bram Stoker's *Dracula* (1897) – and as I must be insufferable and point out, its predecessor *Carmilla* (1872) – are both about ownership of one's body and mind, about violation and injury to agency, about coercion and subjugation. They are about a toxic, sick supposed love. They are gothic and both have rural castles where isolated people lose their minds, and a great deal of men explaining local folklore so everyone can comprehend what's going on. "Harken to me!", etc.

Nothing wrong with any of that, but my favorite vampire stories have something important: **way more vampires**.

- In Jim Jarmusch's *Only Lovers Left Alive* (2013), we follow a vampire couple (Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston!), married for centuries, deal with their bratty sister and their beloved mentor, the Renaissance playwright Christopher Marlowe, played elegiacally by John Hurt.
- In the delightfully silly and sick-looking *Underworld* (2003), Kate Beckinsale is an unruly lieutenant in a coven of vampires eternally battling lycans in shiny leather and bickering with each other.
- *The Witcher 3: Blood and Wine* (2016) treats vampires as another species of creature, with multiple genuses that range from giant were-bats, to topless blood-soaked women reduced to their base hunger, to condescending, near-immortal fancy-pants aristocrats.
- The cult-classic *Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines* (otherwise known as *VtMB*, 2004) has the player navigate a early-2000s urban fantasy of *seven* different clans of vampire politicking and fighting, centuries of stately bureaucracy bashing into the grimy and the monstrous outcast elements.
- In the world of *Daybreakers* (2009) **everyone is a vampire**, and they can be civilized and carry on every day until the moment resources get tight, when they figuratively and literally become the monsters they are.

As an aside: Why the fuck aren't you watching AMC's [*Interview with the Vampire*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3960394/)? I've written before about how the state of TV is constantly proselytizing your favorite shows at family gatherings and in group chats, but I'll beg even harder than I did for [*The Great*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2235759/): it is astonishing television, and you should be watching.

In all these weird and wonderful pieces vampirism is simultaneously more the subject of the work and matter of fact or nature, and the joy is watching bunches of vampires bounce off each other, clutching to stay in the world as hard as they can – the more years of life, the more desperate.

I love when vampires have societies and rules in a feeble attempt to restrain themselves – in *VtMB* the rules a vampire must follow are nakedly called [The Masquerade](https://vtmb.fandom.com/wiki/The_Masquerade)! I love when immortality is a curse and a daily inconvenience – multiple entries above deal with maintaining a consistent blood supply and how the modern world, with its pesky surveillance state, makes draining the life out of the innocent more difficult for the sunlight-challenged.

Meanwhile, Emily loves hundreds of years of pining and messy relationships that traipse through history, blood-sucking drama queens lashing out at the only creatures that can understand. She loves how immortality makes characters question "why even stay alive?" One possible answer is that even these depraved monsters can be redeemed – especially if they have [white hair, elf ears, and puppy dog eyes](https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/18no4oj/playing_bg3_wife_walks_by_sees_astarion/).

Luckily there's a vampire out there for everyone. *Nosferatu* isn't mine, but it might be yours!
