subheadline: An incredible year of games I had no idea were coming
summary: "This was an unenthusiastic year for me and video games – as I wrote earlier in the year, I feel like I don't get a lot of what I want – satisfying exploration, unique movement, compelling stories – for the massive time commitments required by games compared to any other media. (Last year I put almost 100 hours into *Baldur's Gate 3* and didn't even see the end of it!) Until it wasn't, that is, and I played some new all-time favorites that invigorated me and made me try to articulate what I love about games specifically."

This was an unenthusiastic year for me and video games – as I wrote earlier in the year, I feel like I don't get a lot of what I want – satisfying exploration, unique movement, compelling stories – for the massive time commitments required by games compared to any other media. (Last year I put almost 100 hours into *Baldur's Gate 3* and didn't even see the end of it!) Until it wasn't, that is, and I played some new all-time favorites that invigorated me and made me try to articulate what I love about games specifically.

I played games pretty consistently, but as a way to hang out with friends. *Golf with Your Friends*, *Fortnite* and *Halo: Infinite* remain mainstays out of habit, not out of any elevated feeling of fun when playing.

*Minecraft* has made a strong resurgence when a group of friends started a realm recently. Crucially, we're all able to put roughly the same amount of hours into it, so the burden and bolstering is evenly shared. Also, and this is so incredibly important for me, modding *Minecraft* has gotten so much fucking easier over the years, and [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/) is as close to a modern package manager as the elderly game has, enabling me to maximize performance and add much-needed quality of life features with ease. Without it I wouldn't be playing *Minecraft*, period. (Maybe a lil' post about my favorite mods and modpacks is in the future!)

The upsetting thing is that tons of great-looking games are coming out all the time! To all of them: this isn't about you, it's about me. My dopamine pathways are either charred like a burned-down rainforest or carved narrowly like an ancient [slot canyon](https://stories.strava.com/articles/10-of-the-most-beautiful-slot-canyons-in-the-desert-southwest). If I had infinite money I'd buy and shelve all of you by way of apology.

Ergo, here are some games I bought, thought were neat, and never played again: *Tactical Breach Wizards*, *Caravan Sandwitch*, and *Enshrouded*. I dropped them on the steps of the nearest orphanage, hopeful they'll find a home.

Now, here are the three games that made me continue loving games, even against my will:

## Little Kitty, Big City

Exploring a slice of a city as a little black cat, causing mild havoc and gaining strength and movement mechanics as you go? Excellent. But that's not all – there are plenty of charming, and charmingly meaningful, additions that make *Little Kitty, Big City* smart in its design and clever in its implementation. There are sunspots to bask in tucked away around the blocks; there are silly hats to find or buy from crows; you control each paw with the triggers to blithely knock things over. The writing is whimsical without being twee, which is a rare strength that solidifies the game as one to recommend to anyone with a Switch or similar. Lastly, the final climb back to the apartment from whence the titular little kitty came from is a brilliant culmination of the mechanics learned, and the only time I can think of where a game let you back out into its open world and it made sense. At any point, the little fella can come back to the bustling streets below – there might still be shinies to find.

## Indiana Jones and the Great Circle

I'm not finished with this just yet – I'm pretty sure I just finished the second of four areas in this massive, old-fashioned use of the word "epic" game – but there's much to say.

MachineGames did it again is a good tl;dr – they've elevated first-person games to new heights with their craftsmanship, pivoting from the hectic ultra-violence and tragic opera of their grind/art-house *Wolfenstein* games to a deliberate puzzle/stealth combo that rewards avoiding violence altogether. When it does happen, it's with whip-cracking punch sound effects and satisfying facist ragdolls, but Indiana as an avatar is a repository for ancient knowledge, able to surface Christian mysticism, Egyptology, and more with the blink of an eye. That's his superpower.

The first act in the Vatican is by itself one of the greatest games I've ever played; a tightly-constructed, densely layered immersive-sim maze of marble mechanisms and dastardly disguises I loved every minute of. Alongside the stunning level of detail are myriad mechanics that actually make use of it: Indy's camera acts as a prompt for his observations and knowledge; notes are objects that get turned over in your hand to find secrets scrawled on the back; mysteries are solved by really *looking* at the ground, sky, and walls that surround you, not by hitting the "show me" button – a miracle of art direction and design.

The whole thing is a miracle as I'm concerned, and while I could see this being a *Baldur's Gate 3* scenario – it took time, patience, and a warchest to make these games, and lightning doesn't readily strike twice, so why try – I hope MachineGames gets the chance to make more of whatever the hell they want.

## Echo Point Nova

Back in October I wrote about *Echo Point Nova* and asked if it had ["killed gaming"]({{<relref "2024-10-30 Did Echo Point Nova Kill Gaming">}}) for me. Luckily it hasn't – *Indiana Jones* has saved it for now – but the interactive part of my media diet is getting thinner and more desperate, hungry for exactly what this insane hit to the senses can provide.

Why am I not playing *Echo Point Nova* right now? I want to wait until I can properly savor the game again, drink deeply and be as lit up with joy as I was the first time, but then again it's available to me any time.

There's nothing I can write that will explain this game adequately either; if you know, you know. If you grew up playing first person shooters, maybe especially the weirder ones like *Tribes* or *F.E.A.R.*, this is a siren song. This is for the real ones.

## 2025??

Perusing the "most anticipated" lists for 2025 is like looking at a stagnant pond for me. There's life there, but it's mosquitoes buzzing for your attention before sucking your blood. (In this metaphor you pay them $70 for the privilege.) The titles I want – *The Wolf Among Us 2*, *Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2* – are vapor-ware.

I think I have to remember that being surprised is the goal. None of the three games I adored this year were on my radar, they just showed up! Giving things a chance is a costly game, especially *for games*, but it can yield great results. If I had all the time, money, and brain-power to spare, it'd be just about all I do, but things have changed and I think I'm going to be pickier than ever. I am my own best curator, but that's because I live with me and I know what weird shit he's into.
