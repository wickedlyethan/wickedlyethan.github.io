It's true! Pinball is the game for all people of all ages, and there was nowhere better to be on Friday night than [Pintastic New England](https://pintasticnewengland.com/) with friends, where $30 gets your free play on tables from across history, from [*Safecracker* (1996)](https://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=3782) to [*Paragon* (1979)](https://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=1755) to my drug of choice: Stern's excellently overwhelming [*Jurassic Park* (2019)](https://sternpinball.com/game/jurassic-park/).

I'm a pinball novice – the most pinball I've played is [*Pokémon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire* (2003)](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Pinball:_Ruby_%26_Sapphire) on the Game Boy Advance. (My favorite incident was playing it on my phone instead of suffering through my own college graduation.) As such I'm not very good at any particular table, but I find the variety between tables and the stimulus overload of lights and noises pretty close to addictive. From the same simple mechanic – keep the damn ball moving – you can have a huge variety of experiences and levels of complexity, all of which are delightfully obtuse and always adorned with gorgeous (if frequently horny) art.

Something I've noticed after two visits to Pintastic is the complete cross-section of society who play pinball, from old men to punks to kids and families. ([Pop's Pinball Parlor](https://www.bowmarketsomerville.com/tenants/popspinball) in Somerville is run by two hipster dudes, and groups like "The Belles and Chimes of New England" play there, what a vibe.)

Then there's the pretty metal vibe of pinball machines themselves, which are [insanely complicated](https://youtu.be/Tmg5WOvPKpU?si=qMPo8Bf0fV_VUl3Q) and temperamental, sometimes requiring ripping the table open and soldering on the fly. Play sessions are brutally short by default and only get more stressful the longer they go – between the three of us the most common reaction to anything happening was "Wait WHAT", followed by "SHIT!"

The other good news about pinball is that it's everywhere – pinball appears to have had a resurgence during the pandemic, like many vintage forms of gaming, and shows like Pintastic will only get bigger.

Meanwhile I've anecdotally seen "amusement centers" popping up all over the area, taking over the hollowed-out husks of mall department stores and stuffing them with laser tag, VR booths, and trampoline parks – one nearby fittingly filled the corpse of a Toys R' Us. These aren't for me and people my age per se, but they're great to see as an evolution of what I grew up on, maybe minus the cardboard-adjacent pizza and stained plastic pitchers of soda. (I will state authoritatively we had better arcade cabinets: we played *Time Crisis 2* (1997) and *Tekken 3* (1997), while the newer arcades are stocked with the aggressively mediocre [Raw Thrills](https://rawthrills.com/) brand machines.)

Physical game spaces like [Level 99](https://level99.com/) and the bonkers [Boda Borg](https://www.bodaborg.com/) are a whole other taxonomy of play that, post-pandemic, appear to be having a resurgence as people want to get the fuck out of the house and hang out with the people they were separated from for so long.

All this to say that playing games in public is *back*, and pinball is the oldest institution around, so find your local flipper flophouse and I bet you'll have a great time.
