title: "'The City that Lit the World': Visiting the New Bedford Whaling Museum"
---
Over the past few years I’ve felt a nascent history dork side of myself come to life, and last weekend I engaged with the dorkiest, dadliest kind of history – maritime history – and went to the New Bedford Whaling Museum with my dad and Emily. Whether I love history because I grew up in New England or love New England because of its rich history is a chicken-and-egg question, but where the regional meets global is fascinating: the industrial revolution and its discontents.

The mid- to late-19th century was a time when the greatest and worst of humanity were happening at once at a scale never seen before; barbarism and new notions of civilization clashed violently and left blood in the water and on the looms. To me it is an amazing, **terrible** time, and I can’t look away; the dark, bizarre history of whaling is a dramatic distillation of all those themes.

In 1891, the Sharon Sanatorium for Pulmonary Disease opened in my hometown of Sharon, Massachusetts. The largest of three buildings remaining was a children’s pavilion for treating tuberculosis (truly, Mr. Green, [everything is tuberculosis](https://everythingistb.com/)), alongside Matron’s quarters and a separate building for performing X-rays, a technology that wasn’t invented when the sanatorium opened but became crucial for the diagnosis of TB.

As if that history wasn’t macabre enough, when the sanatorium closed in 1950 the property was purchased by the industrialist Henry P. Kendall and six years later that children’s pavilion was converted into the Kendall Whaling Museum, curating his private collection of historical artifacts from around the world about whales and whaling.

It operated until 2001, and as a Cub Scout of all things I must have visited, because I have a memory of a musky, stale room filled with harpoons and spades and scrimshaw.[^1] The only [video evidence](https://www.c-span.org/program/vignette/kendall-whaling-museum/153710) I can find of the museum makes it look blinding and sterile. Stuart Frank, the director of the museum in 1998 when the C-Span segment was shot, speaks admirably about the long history of whaling, the multiculturalism of the collection, and the spiritual connections humans have had to whales for millennia. This is undercut somewhat by the title of the museum – it is the whaling museum, not the whale museum – and is a component tension of the New Bedford Whaling Museum today, which bought and merged the Kendall Whaling Museum collection in 2001. (Today the Sharon Sanatorium is The Trustees’ [Archives and Research Center](https://thetrustees.org/place/archives-research-center/).)

The New Bedford Whaling Museum in 2025 is a great, if unsettling, experience. Comprehensive, updated, and progressive in its curation, the museum has artifacts from around the world placed in the context of their respective cultures respectively and respectfully, alongside a half-scale model of a historical whaling sloop, [the *Lagoda*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagoda), commissioned in 1916, and much more. You might bang your head on its shrunken-down decks – I did, on a properly cast metal ship’s bell by the wheel – but it’s a thrill, and my dad giddily described what it might have been like climbing up the robes of the main mast. We all went quiet when we noticed the pulley system terminating in a monstrous hook near the try works, a set of furnaces for melting blubber on deck [^2].

The same rapaciousness that made industrialists hire crews to hunt whales to the ends of the Earth – ships leaving New Bedford sailed to the Azores, Tierra del Fuego, Japan, and New Zealand, months or years at a time – led them to be deeply diligent about it. As with other horrors in history there were systems and tools made for the tasks at hand, and whales were chased, lashed, chopped, and disassembled at sea with ruthless efficiency, the carcass carelessly discarded. (Scrimshaw came about as a way to pass the time on ships on long voyages; later the bones were used to make goods like smoking pipes and pocket watch stands, the invisible hand of the market at work.)

The oleometer was invented to measure the purity of whale oil when it reached custom houses and then was graded by smell. Spermaceti, a substance found in sperm whales, was the source of the finest candles, and New Bedford became known as [“the city that lit the world”](https://www.nps.gov/nebe/index.htm)[^3]. The mills built more complex machines and whale oils were used to create dozens of varieties of industrial lubricants – Bill Nye the Science Guy’s grandfather, William F. Nye,  invented special formulas for [chronometers on whaling ships, bicycles, music boxes, and more](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/a-whale-oiled-machine/). (The company, Nye Lubricants, exists today.)

Herman Melville’s epic *Moby Dick* obviously haunts the city and the museum to this day. Narrator Ishmael describes New Bedford as full of beautiful women (“the fine carnation of their cheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens”), luxury (“nowhere in all America will you find more patrician-like houses; parks and gardens more opulent, than in New Bedford”), and “cannibals”[^4]:

> ...in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners; savages outright; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh. It makes a stranger stare.

There are quote banners throughout the New Bedford museum – the museum hosts an [annual reading marathon](https://www.whalingmuseum.org/program/moby-dick-marathon-2025/) of the 200,000 word tome. The largest single artifact of the museum is a [Yankee whaleboat](https://www.teachingmelville.org/whale-boats), bought by Kendall as its mother ship was decommissioned in the early 1900s. The diminutive craft would be manned by six men and carry ten thousand feet of rope, and Ahab himself would have stood at the bow and harpooned whales two to five times the size of his boat, beginning a lengthy and brutal death.

In the lobby of the museum there are four whale skeletons hanging suspended from the ceiling. One of them, KOBO (short for “King of the Blue Ocean”, one of four blue whale skeletons in the world), is sixty-six feet long, has been on display for twenty-four years, and to this day is [oozing oil](https://www.wpri.com/news/street-stories/blue-whale-skeleton-at-new-bedford-museum-still-leaking-oil/). Emily noticed the smell; my dad noticed the black splotches on the stone floor; I noticed the tube running from a drain pan between KOBO’s jaw bones to a nearby beaker, tucked away and unremarked upon. Black and greasy[^5], the oil feels ancient and ominous, as do the whale’s bones staring me down. Staff from the New Bedford Whaling Museum say KOBO is “expected to stop leaking within the next 30 to 40 years”.

To learn about whaling is to put obsession and madness next to historical facts and practicalities. The world then was bustling with invention and progress, but the price was high and brutal in many ways, the whales only one. (Certainly there are no modern corollaries to that.) I recommend the New Bedford Whaling Museum, but go on an overcast, drizzling day to match the mood.

> Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing. When you think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler form. – *Moby Dick, or The Whale*, chapter 41.

There's a lot more I could've written, but I was already straining my capabilities of writing a good (I hope) blog post, so here are some topics that didn't make it in but are worth mentioning:

- The New England Aquarium [recently spotted](https://www.seacoastonline.com/story/lifestyle/nature-wildlife/2025/01/17/75-endangered-right-whales-gather-off-the-coast-of-maine/77745548007/) seventy-five right whales off the coast of Maine – 20% of the total critically-endangered population in one place. This is great news, but the [International Whaling Commission](https://iwc.int/about-whales/whale-species/right-whale) writes that “More than 60% of North Atlantic right whales have scarring that indicates some interaction with fishing gear. Some individual whales have carried rope and bits of gear on their bodies for months or years, eventually experiencing long slow deaths from infected wounds or lost feeding opportunities caused by the gear.” Madness prevails.
- In the Faroe Islands, the yearly tradition of *‌grindadráp* leads to hundreds of whales and dolphins to be driven to shore then slaughtered every year. Regulations stipulate that the animals must be killed with a [specific knife](https://theanimalfund.net/en/faroes-island-hunt/) (*‌mønustingari*) by someone with a special training certificate. I'm not equipped to truly analyze this phenomenon and I don't want to pass judgement on a cultural tradition dating back to the 9th century, but it's grim stuff.
- In the world of free to play video games – *Fortnite*, *Overwatch*, *Genshin Impact*, *Monopoly GO!*, etc. – players who spend a disproportionate amount of money on the game, and in effect "keep them afloat", are called whales. This is an industry term with [real bad takes around it](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/big-spending-whales-arent-the-problem-with-free-to-play-games-opinion).
- Speaking of video games, the stunning 2012 immersive-sim masterpiece *Dishonored* takes place in the city of [Dunwall](https://dishonored.fandom.com/wiki/Dunwall), a fantasy whaling city powered by its main export, whale oil. Their bones are used to inscribe dark magic and they float in the Void. Lead designer Harvey Smith called whales ["creatures of beauty and sadnesss"](https://dishonored.fandom.com/wiki/Dishonored_Wiki?file=Whales_and_outsider_commentary.jpg).

[^1]: Furthermore, there were little kids there during our visit to the New Bedford Whaling Museum, and I have to ask: why??

[^2]: In 2003’s [*Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0311113/), which absolutely sparked this interest in me from a young age, the crew of the HMS *Surprise* defile their own ship and burn oil on the deck to make black smoke and pretend to be whalers to pull a fast one on the French.

[^3]: “In New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their daughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece. You must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they say, they have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti candles.” – *Moby Dick, or The Whale*, chapter 6.

[^4]: Melville also mocks lumberjacks from Vermont and New Hampshire coming to become whalers – “Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence they came” – but wouldn’t want you to get the wrong impression about New Bedford, oh no: “But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals, and bumpkins to show her visitors. Not at all.”

[^5]: The oil secreting from KOBO reminded me greatly of the curse laid upon the boar gods from *Princess Mononoke* (1997), which we had the privilege of seeing in its new 4k transfer in IMAX last weekend. How timely.
