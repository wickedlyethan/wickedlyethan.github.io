## Books

### Prayer for the Crown-Shy by Becky Chambers

I was trying to be good and write about books that came out this year - striving to be contemporary, for once - but I have to, and *must*, talk about this book.

I'm deeply jealous at how amazing a writer Becky Chambers is, but the truth is it is a privilege to get to read books this good. Every work of hers I've read - *To be Taught, if Fortunate*, *A Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet*, and *A Psalm for the Wild-Built* - have instantly become not only favorites of mine, but texts to turn to in bad times. These are fountains of hope, portals to other places where the definition of "humanity" might be stretched, but its best possible tenets are exemplified. 

[*Prayer for the Crown-Shy*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40864030-a-prayer-for-the-crown-shy) in particular is such an antidote to our current hellscape that it has to be recommended on that merit alone, but it's not escapism! It's better than that, and I hope Chambers knows. I'm not sure how I can treasure them more other than proselytize them to everyone I know.

### Black River Orchard by Chuck Wendig

I had the pleasure of seeing Wendig at a author talk in Cambridge alongside the venerable folklorist Aaron Mankhe, and he described his 2019 novel *Wanderers* as his "anxiety book" - a novel built out of all the things that were freaking him out at the time. If that's the case, then [*Black River Orchard*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75352300-black-river-orchard) is built out of all the things that he knew would freak **me** out. 

A cursed variety of apple gives its devoted devourers better lives and inspires complete devotion to it and the man who controls it - from there this thing freaking goes places. Demagoguery, body horror, abusive families, feeling trapped in a wide open place - there's a lot going on here and all of it starts at unnerving and gets worse from there, while staying at a steady pace and shoving you along, saying "oh no, there's more, much worse things over here". This is Wendig's densest text yet, and the product of his own pandemic-time obsession with apples; their history, their place as an object of folklore and metaphor, their ubiquity even as they are freakish products of nature.

### Vampires of El Norte by Isabel Cañas

In her [charming and thrilling adventure-romance](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63892214-vampires-of-el-norte) set in the potent specificity of 1840s Mexico, as it is under constant threat of becoming part of Texas by force, Cañas writes the best arc of "lovers to enemies and back to lovers" I personally have ever read. Nena and Néstor don't simply reunite many years after a tragic night as teenagers, attacked by one of the titular vampires - they have a believable tension that turns to fireworks eventually, but there's a lot of back and forth and revealing of information that feels earned, realistic, and deliciously dramatic. Cañas renders each of her protagonist's fully from within in their own chapters, then lets us see how the other side of the pair sees and attempts to understand them.

The plot stays simple - Nena and Néstor leave the ranch to aid Mexican forces in the war then have to get back before those forces reach El Norte, all the while being hunted by vampires that per local folklore are ghoulish, gray monsters that happen to bite on the neck rather than a more aristocratic vein of apparition. The star of the show here are the heroic couple, who flare up and cool off and find a deeper love among dusty cacti, pools of blood, and their own many battle wounds. 

### Happy Place by Emily Henry

I'm new to the scene of romance novels, riding the wave of Emily Henry's ascension to so-called chick-lit royalty. This being her fourth novel in as many years (she's on a tear that's for sure), the patterns are starting to emerge: champagne problems, first-time flirting that doesn't quite read as natural, keeping secrets because well, it's simply too late now.

[*Happy Place*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61718053-happy-place) elevates itself with its larger cast - surrounding our protagonists with long-time friends lets histories, tensions, and fireworks mingle in every moment and prompts further examination of the core couple's unraveling (and possible, hopeful re-imagining) once they're off-stage and forced to be alone, the inverse of Henry's earlier novels and, from my limited reading, other novels in the genre. Here Wynn and Harriet have nowhere to hide: not from everyone else, not from each other, and not from themselves.

Honorable Mentions: [*Gwen and Art Are Not in Love*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61885131-gwen-art-are-not-in-love) by Lex Croucher, [*Saga*, Volume 11](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29237226-saga-volume-11) by Brian K. Vaughn and Fiona Staples.

## Movies

### The Boy and the Heron

Hayao Miyazaki's latest is a thorn in my mind I can't get out. The first half is a tightly-paced magical realism tale of a boy being forced to move through grief, bristling and rageful under his rigid politness; the second half is a painfully earnest, bonkers fantasia about legacy and art and probably everything else ever. The truth is I love that first half more than the second half, and I'm disappointed by the turn of the titular Heron from genuinely frightening harbinger to sometimes-forgotten, puckish comedic relief. The kitchen-sink approach to the movie makes sense meta-textually, but in the theater you need to go "sure, why not" and remember that you're being taken care of by a madman with the greatest artists and artisans in this medium at his disposal, and he's not afraid to make them work.

### Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves

Did you expect this movie to be good? I didn't expect this movie to be good, but this movie is good. Not even "for what it is" good - it's smart, earnest, and consistent. It could've been bad, cringe-inducing, nihilistic, cynical with its intellectual property but no, it's a good time. All it wants to do is make sure you have a blast, and I do every time I watch it.

### Oppenheimer

On the other end of the spectrum from *Honor Among Thieves* is Christopher Nolan's three-hour opus, a movie that's too big to put your arms around. Two different plots, decades of history, theoretical physics, and the fate of the entire world converge without shooting a single bullet or showing a single army. In thinking [about the film's score](https://ethanthibault.com/blog/my-favorite-film-scores-of-2023/) I find myself returning to importance of all the moments leading up to the first test of the atomic bomb - the test itself isn't what Nolan is interested in. The trials and mechanical tribulations of getting such a monstrous thing working aren't the story of Oppenheimer's bomb; it's the collapsing of all the decisions made to get him there, the consequences of which collide and split with force that rivals the bomb, and roll over the Earth - ours and Oppenheimer's. 

### The Marvels

My love for this movie is partly contrarian, I have to admit - watching an earnest, simple, loudly fun movie die on arrival as a sacrifice to years of rushed, awful decisions from everyone's problematic fave mega-corporation sucks. As with any movie, but especially these massive blockbuster-intended affairs, thousands of people made a thing as best they could and that rules. That it's this *weird* is another miracle and I'm all for it. To hell with everyone hand-wringing that *this* is what will make the MCU course-correct; is any of [this](https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/full-list-of-all-upcoming-marvel-movies/) what you freaking want?

Honorable Mentions: *Godzilla Minus One*, *Barbie*, *Nimona*

## TV

The current television landscape is pretty weird - there's more than ever, from an increasingly diverse list of places thanks to the dubious ubiquity of streaming platforms, but no one is watching the same things. A companion to the Dying Internet Theory is the Death of Monoculture, and that's several media studies thesis papers right there so I don't feel the need to go into it, in part because you know what I mean. Most of the time we're not talking about the shows we all watched, we're trying to convince each other to give the time (and subscription dollars) required to what you personally watched lately. We're all salespeople now for the little universes we love most. 

I didn't jive with *Scavengers Reign*; I'm allergic to everything related to *Succession*;  I know I need to watch *The Bear* and *Reservation Dogs*, - I can't tell you why I haven't.

Can I interest you in [*Silo*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZYhuvIv1pA), the taut and expertly crafted dystopian thriller about the last of humanity living underground? No? Did you ever finally check out [*The Great*](https://youtu.be/1sMrtt7sAR8?si=hrSSNKtyfZD7e5OI) like I've been bleating about for the past THREE YEARS? Yes I know the SEO is bad, it can be tough to find but it's freaking amazing. Tony McNamara is that guy who makes stiff-backed, aristocratic characters say the foulest shit imaginable, what's not to like? Oh. Yeah no you're busy, I get it. I heard *Beef* was good! I can't do cringe comedy. I've got enough of that by living.

Well I know you didn't watch [*The Double Fine Psychoddyssey*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIhLvue17Sd70y34zh2erWWpMyOnh4UN_). That one is niche, I get that, but it helped me re-contextualize my never-ending creative yearnings and let me grieve for a part of myself I forcefully killed to get away from an industry made out of exploitative labor practices and prayers. Too heavy? My bad.

Ok fine if you need to turn your brain off while feeling smart - no, don't go rewatch *The West Wing*. I did that too this year, that wasn't what I was going to say. Go watch [*Reacher*](https://youtu.be/GSycMV-_Csw?si=sa5vms72wyWzV4Wc). This dude, Alan Ritchson, is HUGE and born for this role, a.k.a. Jack Reacher, the dude your dad (it's peak dad TV) has been reading the adventures of since 1997. He's the new James Bond, but way better because he gets to be absurdly smart, expertly lethal, bluntly charming, and wield a strong moral compass while being comically violent. He kicks a car so hard it sets off the airbag one time. Are you kidding me? I freaking love this show, you should give it a shot. Seriously, write it in Apple Notes or something. No yeah, I added *Poker Face* to the list, I promise.

Honorable mentions: Being pretty thoroughly haunted by *The Last of Us*; Bingeing *The Diplomat*; Wrapping up *Ted Lasso* so well I forgot about it; *Bocchi the Rock* made me happy.

## Games

### Baldur's Gate 3

What's there to say that hasn't been said about BG3? The scope and complexity of it boggles the mind, and to have all that alongside strong, wickedly funny character writing and a clockwork simulation of D&D all in one package makes it pretty obvious why this game has dominated so many player's brains since release.

Does that mean its perfect? No, not at all. Act I is perfect; Act II is a very big tone shift that doesn't always nail it; Act III should be the catharsis that makes it all worth it, but you know what I can barely run it on my computer so I haven't actually finished it yet. My wife however, she finished it - really, she sucked the marrow from its bones then started it over again pretty much immediately - and the game's conclusion soured me on it enough to put it away for a while, no longer compelled to get all the way to the end with all the flaws and flubs in my bugged-out playthrough. 

That all doesn't diminish that we think or talk about this game every day (much of it to my chagrin; the pale elf fans are legion) and that's a victory in any age, but especially this one, where everything moves so quickly and games are consumed then forgotten. The patch notes alone for this behemoth could qualify as game of the year; there's nothing close. 

### The Playdate

This [little yellow savior](https://play.date/) gave me peace and distraction in airports, on buses, and in hotel lobbies this year after suffering in a dark drawer for too long. Effortless to play and hugely varied in kinds of games to experience, the Playdate has grown into a relentlessly charming toy filled with little treats to come back to whenever you want, even if it's just for a little bit. It'll always be excited to see you.

### Rhythm Games

Rhythm games are something I'm not great at but have a lot of affection for. Stepping to the nostalgia of playing Rock Band on various Wiis or Dance Dance Revolution on those awful foam pads during after-school care, for example. It's always amusing that I've been playing drums for 16 years and should be a lot better at these than I am - my timing is "JUSTICE CRITICAL", but my individual finger coordination is "POOR", to use their parlance.

A few of them caught my ears this year, all earnest delights in different form factors - [*Taiko no Tatsujin Pop Tap Beat*](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/taiko-no-tatsujin-pop-tap-beat/id1463360242) on the iPad, [Chunithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZZ4C0Wc3VM) at our local rhythm game arcade, and [*Spin Rhythm XD*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1058830/Spin_Rhythm_XD/) for the Steam Deck. 

The music itself in these games is a hit or miss affair - Fortnite's festival mode can fuck off with its paltry, rotating, and battle-pass gated playlist of guitar/bass/drums classics like "Bad Romance" and "Party Rock Anthem", to start, and games like *IIDX* and *Chunithm* largely feature a brand of hyper-aggressive pop and nitecore tracks that assault the brain, but an anime opening rock song or [dirty-bass fever dream](https://youtu.be/xZZ4C0Wc3VM?si=wywE8_TBzcbsIKsG) can get you to dump credits without hesitation. Here's where *Spin Rhythm XD* comes out on top - its collection is diverse, independent, and expertly charted to the insanely cool input method of using the freaking *trackpads* on the Steam Deck to spin DJ wheels into alignment with notes. Addictive stuff.

### Counter Strike 2

This year's entry into the "highest highs, lowest lows" of gaming. Tired of Fortnite's endless waves of complication and simplification, I wanted to try something so inert that it could reliably be played every day and be the exact same. Every round, every match slight variations in my cursed land of casual where ten players on each team hurl themselves down one of a few corridors and, as [Girlfriend Reviews](https://youtu.be/mBtSxo69MZE?si=vSimpGvjjtVX6VfF) puts it, "waits for the other team to throw every grenade in the world, then there's one minute of panic and jump scares until everyone's dead or something explodes".

When it works, it works, okay? Even with its icky-feeling conceit and aesthetic trappings, horrifically toxic community, brutal difficulty... OK, the deck is stacked against this one. I know I shouldn't like it, but a round here or there proves a headshot is a headshot and has been since FPS Doug told us so in 2004. Some things never change, even when they probably should.

That's it for this year and what a long, strange trip it's been. I am blissfully unaware of any of the big media things coming in 2024, so I aim to be surprised. I've got more places than ever to experience all the things, after all, and the real trick is listening to the winds and adjusting my fuel mixture. Every medium takes the bench for a while, and then I come back and am giddy all over again. Rebooting the 4K blu-ray player, dusting off the Steam Deck, bringing home a pile of books from the library; these are my favorite sacred rituals. Hopefully you enjoyed some great stuff too this year.
