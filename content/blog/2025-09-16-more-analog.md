subtitle: Too few brainworms to be an influencer, not cool enough to be a Luddite
summary: My wife bought an analog watch the other day, and it felt like a sea change. I’ve found a lot of joy lately in making my life more analog lately by consciously choosing to not engage with the latest and supposedly greatest of technologies, and I’ve found my life to feel slower, more intentional, and a lot less stressful because of it. At risk of being utterly pretentious and reductive, here’s a bunch of ways to do the same.

My wife bought a [tiny Timex analog field watch](https://timex.com/products/expedition-field-mini-26mm-leather-strap-watch-tw4b12000)  the other day and it felt like a sea change. In June, the piece of shit HHS secretary vomited the idea that every American should be [wearing a health tracker](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/future-pulse/2025/06/24/rfk-jr-wants-a-wearable-on-your-wrist-00419190), and we instantly soured on wearing our Fitbits every day. We had been talking through our fixation on the daily numbers, the waves of guilt and the rush of a new high score, but this was the nail in the coffin. I think we’re turning into "techno hippies", which I use instead of Luddite because the Luddites were [badass](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/brian-merchant/blood-in-the-machine/9780316487740/) in a way that we’re not – we’re simply exhausted.

I’ve found a lot of joy lately in making my life more “analog”, which I also use loosely. I’m not abdicating the internet and taking up whittling per se, but I am consciously choosing to not engage with the latest and supposedly greatest of technologies, and I’ve found my life to feel slower, more intentional, and a lot less stressful because of it. At risk of being utterly pretentious and reductive, here’s a bunch of ways to make your life more “analog”:

## Fuck off, AI

It seems to me so obvious that I almost forgot to put it in the list, but don’t use generative AI. Just don’t! It’s much simpler *not* to use it, because you simply continue living your life as you have for the majority of its runtime[^1].

## Magazines killed the algorithm star

Use websites that rely on algorithmic personalization, if you must, logged out. This has two effects: exposing how gross and unsubtle the algorithms are, and lessening your personal data footprint at least a little bit. My daily example is Reddit: I deleted my account when third-party apps were destroyed, and while I still have a deeply ingrained problem, the site is less “good” now to the point that I have meaningfully reduced my time there. You can see businesses and events on Facebook without an account usually, and you can check a public Instagram profile for three seconds before realizing you don’t care.

Relatedly, check algorithmic news aggregators while logged out. What I notice is that in the continuing degradation of our pathetic media ecosystem, horrible sources rise to the top by default. Apple News *loves* the Wall Street Journal, for example; Google News thinks the White House itself is a legitimate source of news, instead of the subject of reporting. You’re seeing the news, but you can remember that you’re seeing what Google wants you to see.

Better yet, stop reading online news! Check out these crazy things called *magazines*. They’re digital too now but take a lot more care and thought from their editorial staff, and don’t artificially inflate read times to accommodate more ads. They publish less frequently, therefore you can read them less frequently and achieve the useful remove from “the news” that was the default in days before 24/7 news coverage[^2]. I get mine for free from the library IRL or via Libby.

I would be remiss to not mention the thriving world of Substacks and smaller online news sites, which I actively support, but I mean here to write about "news", as in politics, the economy, etc. You know, awful shit that matters a lot, unfortunately. Those smaller publications and newsletters have the same benefits as magazines for certain topics, but they usually don't have larger editorial teams, global reporters, and fancy lawyers that give them a principled baseline of defense to, in theory, report the truth.

## Keep an eye on the time

Wear a watch! They’re cool, beautiful objects and you can express yourself. Don’t look at your ~~torment nexus~~ phone to find out when you are and risk falling in, stay here instead.

Try a planner! I already was a stationery dork but I recently hopped on the [Hobonichi Techo train](https://youtu.be/OO-YNP0YT-4?si=C1lGmQTWVqk6bbXN) and a planner has done me wonders. My to do app has become a *long term repository* for things I want to get done, not my daily driver. Bonus, it’s another fun object that I can personalize.

The wonderful [How To ADHD](https://youtu.be/Vzwyl1E-BKQ?si=jsx4YyW2-r2qb6G2) influenced me into buying a [Time Timer](https://www.timetimer.com/products/time-timer-mod-home-edition) and again, it’s a fun object that keeps me away from yet another app and it works! I use mine for writing, for using the Pomodoro method to break down work into smaller chunks, and for what we call “ten minute tidies”, which is when we see how much we can [knoll](https://youtu.be/U46Yo_6z_F4?si=HsOYn_9GDY3ZGRwV&t=161) and clean in the apartment in only ten minutes to make it bearable. You have more small chunks of time in the day than you realize.

## Use an un-opinionated camera

Your phone camera is a miracle of engineering and software development; it also produces over-edited “idealized” images that are [stretching the definition of a photograph](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/23/24252231/lets-compare-apple-google-and-samsungs-definitions-of-a-photo).

Photography as a hobby is in a fucked up place right now: new cameras are luxury items now, used cameras cost more than their worth, and manufacturers are rolling out lazy refreshes to [satisfy the digicam craze](https://www.theverge.com/news/774095/canon-powershot-elph-360-hsa-kendall-jenner-reissue-price-specs).

BUT, if you have a point and shoot, can afford one, or want to [mess around with film](https://reformedfilmlab.com/products/ilford-ilfocolor-rapid-haf-frame-single-use-camera-54-exposures), a camera that isn’t your phone is a lot of fun and will produce more memorable, emotional photos. The way I’ve been proselytizing to friends and family is that traditional cameras have a lot fewer *opinions* about things than phone cameras do – do you want Apple dictating what your memories of vacation look like? If you have an iPhone, at least check out [Hallide](https://halide.cam/), a camera app that cuts Apple out of the equation.

## Paper, please

Journals, notebooks, sticky notes, memo pads, planners, whiteboards, anything you can write on is automatically a good object. There’s plenty of science behind the [benefits of writing by hand](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/05/11/1250529661/handwriting-cursive-typing-schools-learning-brain) and it’s yet another tool that has been reduced down to our black glass rectangles. Instead of taking notes, thinking aloud in text messages, or desperately trying not to have an original thought, grab any scrap paper around and have some thoughts. It’s simple and addictive![^3]

Don't even get me started on books. Dude, books are *so cool*.

## Desperately trying to reach a conclusion

If all of that blather was too much[^4] (I get it), here's a simple find/replace list:

- Logged in → Logged out
- Online news → magazines
- Clock app → Watch, timers
- Camera app → Whatever camera you can get
- Notes apps, not having thoughts → Journals, notebooks, planners, having lots of thoughts
- This blogger is guilty of owning too many books, highly recommend

When I write it out like that it feels cliché, milquetoast even, but this is a conclusion reached over years of growing dissatisfaction, deep thinking about technology, and a concerted effort to be less digital and more real, with all the consequences, drawbacks, and benefits that come with that ideology. It might take you longer, it might be super easy for you; you might make some small changes, or have a wee crisis like I did.

The important thing is to **think about it**. The enemy of everyone with the power to shape our thinking is us doing it for ourselves.

[^1]: My confession is that I use generative AI at work to do rote, obnoxious tasks. I scare my coworkers by telling them I have “my boot on its neck”, and that “trees don’t vote for axes”, then I force CoPilot to turn screenshots of horrible tables made in Confluence into Markdown. All day. Every day. *That’s* what generative AI is good at.

[^2]: I’ve been impressed by The Guardian Weekly and The Economist (I used to love their “Espresso” daily news app), and have been reading The New Yorker for a long time. Vox has a weekly magazine that sometimes is too human-interest leaning but worth checking out, and The Atlantic sometimes has something good to say. Sometimes.

[^3]: I have seven paper products within reach as I write this. I have strong opinions about the aspect ratio of ISO paper sizes. My paper is imported and I panic bought more recently to avoid tarrifs. A friend of a friend offered to get my next planner in Japan when they visit. Maybe, just maybe, I'm trying to get you to take your first hit.

[^4]: At risk of interrupting my own conclusion, this is one of those Standard Issue Blog Posts that I feel weird about publishing. I genuinely wanted to write this, I had lots to say and I just keep saying it elsewhere in my life, so why not put it in a post, but yeah I'm aware that I haven't blogged anything in a while that wasn't about computing and technology. I promise I contain multitudes.
