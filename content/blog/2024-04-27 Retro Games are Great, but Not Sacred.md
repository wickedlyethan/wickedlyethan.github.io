title: Retro Games are Great, but Not Sacred

A great thing about retro games is that it's always the new best time to play them: [cheap emulator handhelds](https://retrogamecorps.com/) are plentiful and constantly getting better; Apple finally allowed emulators onto the app store due to regulatory pressure and [Delta](https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24132984/delta-free-emulator-nintendo-gba-n64-iphone-app-store-us) is by all reports an incredible option; and FPGA chips are getting more common, so the quality of emulation on certain hardware is near-perfect. You can play old games on any hardware, any time.

I recently picked up an aforementioned cheap emulator handheld – an [Anbernic RG35XX](https://anbernic.com/products/rg35xx?variant=43734118072577) – and finally sank my teeth into all sorts of games I've never gotten the chance to play. Not only am I enjoying them, I'm actually making progress through them instead of playing for 30 minutes then dropping them and saying "that was neat!" I'm about 80% of the way through *[The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_The_Minish_Cap)* (GBA, 2005) after playing hours a day for the past week – I haven't really been playing anything else, apart from an operation in *Helldivers 2* (2024) when friends are around.

I've oscillated between loving original hardware and totally turning my back on it – I've owned and sold a dozen consoles that I barely used, including a pandemic-hobby [modified Game Boy Advance](https://handheldlegend.com/collections/game-boy-advance-gba) and a 2DS XL with custom firmware; I keep a SCPH-1000 Playstation One in a bin for pure nostalgia, not to be used. (Even though I grew up with the much more gorgeous [PS One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_models#PS_One), which believe me I'm tempted to collect despite everything I'm about to write.) All of them feel fragile and fussy no matter what, and that's part of the appeal for many people but not for me. I want less friction, not more component cables.

Instead my silly little Anbernic has quality of life features that let me get over the anachronisms of games that are 15+ years old – instant save states, double and half-speed emulation, a back-lit LCD screen, compatibility for dozens of systems, including the weirdos. (Walkthroughs! We love a [well-made walkthrough](https://www.zeldadungeon.net/the-minish-cap-walkthrough/), what a lifesaver.) I've arrived at the point where I *need* these luxuries, because otherwise I don't have the patience to suffer through obnoxious life systems, obtuse mechanics, overlong repetitive animations, etc. There's a lot to be said for the vibes, the patience required, the conditions under which these games were originally played, stuff like that, but I just don't care any more! To me there's nothing sacred about retro games, but there is a lot to love. I've been thrilled playing *Snatcher* (Sega CD, 1988), *Pokémon FireRed* (GBA, 2004), *Shantae* (GBC, 2002) and more.

Another knock against real hardware: not to step into the "what is art worth" conversation, but *Wild Guns* (1994) is a SNES game that is pretty fun, but not [$200+ on eBay fun](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=Wild+Guns+SNES&_sacat=139973), nor is *Pokémon Crystal* (GBC, 2000), and *Snatcher* surely isn't worth freaking $500.

If the choice is to never experience these games ever or undertake some sailing on the high seas, use legally dubious hardware, and cheat and save spam my way through it, isn't the latter the obvious choice?
