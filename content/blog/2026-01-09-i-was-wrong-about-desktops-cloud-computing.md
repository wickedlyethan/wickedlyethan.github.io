It’s been over a month since I built a mostly-new, microATX gaming desktop, and since then the RAM-pocalypse has blown up, dominating enthusiast tech headlines and reaching into [storage prices](https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/memory/keep-up-to-date-with-the-pc-memory-and-ssd-supply-crisis-as-we-track-prices-and-the-latest-news/). The [single stick of 16 GB DDR5](https://www.microcenter.com/product/688810/gskill-flare-x5-16gb-(1-x-16gb)-ddr5-6000-pc5-48000-cl36-single-channel-desktop-memory-module-f5-6000j3636f16gx1-fx5-black) I bought has almost doubled in price from a rude $90 to a bonkers $190, and Micro Center claims that’s *marked down* from $399.99, as much as a brand-new iPad. Framework, the champion of DIY laptops, has adjusted their memory prices [multiple times](https://frame.work/blog/updates-on-memory-pricing-and-navigating-the-volatile-memory-market) and plans to do so multiple times in the future. Suddenly it is materially even more difficult to own a computer that you own every part of.

Almost 2 years ago I wrote about [personal energy efficiency]({{<relref "blog/2024-06-26-our-lives,-inefficient.md">}}) and referred to PC gaming as my deeply inefficient “unfortunate pass-time”, which reflected both how little gaming is part of my media diet and hobby time nowadays and how irritated I was getting that my aging hardware was struggling with the games I wanted to play with my friends. 

> The question that keeps intruding on my gaming sessions is this: all this, ***for fucking what***? *Fortnite* is not a very good video game, and I haven't been enjoying it lately; *Helldivers 2* is pretty good, but not life-changing, though it is the only co-op experience I have on standby nowadays (RIP *Overwatch*); *Halo Infinite*  runs smoothly enough and is damn good, leading me to think it's the most efficient of the three, even as I set the quality settings to "low" to get the most frames; *Baldur's Gate 3*'s infamous third act brought said system to its knees, so much so that I stopped playing because performance problems were giving me visual migraines.

Updates on those games in particular: 

- It’s true, *Fortnite* is a shit game (to me, most of the time).
- My friend group can never bring itself to return to *Helldivers 2* because of its grinding required to get the big, fun toys it promises.[^1]
- Not sure what I meant by “RIP *Overwatch*”, because it soon became the game I play the most by huge margin, steadily putting in a handful of hours every week with friends and by myself because that game rules. It’s the only game I included in my [“Favorites of 2025”]({{<relref "blog/2025-12-21-favorites-of-2025.md">}}) post.
- *Halo Infinite*?? Dead to me and everyone else. It’s older brother, the *Master Chief Collection*, is both retro fun time and a piece of steaming shit that rarely works.
- *Baldur's Gate 3* still doesn’t run well in the third act. Not that I would know first-hand, because I’m a coward who will never finish my beautiful run and can’t stomach the idea of another 100+ hours to start over.

The answer for a long time was to never turn on my Windows desktop and use Nvidia GeForce Now to stream games when I infrequently wanted to. That’s still the answer for *Overwatch 2*, which as of last testing crashed my new desktop due to a [memory leak]({{<relref "blog/2025-12-03-replacing-windows-with-bazzite.md">}}).

But now put that next to the RAM-pocalypse, AI fuckery, GPUs continuing to be absurd luxury items, and  Xbox’s complete failure in this console cycle leaving the world with two game consoles. Gamers Nexus [went “viral”](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1px9xwx/private_equity_is_killing_private_ownership_first/) for a video claiming that private equity will kill the personal computer similar to how it’s affected the housing market.[^2] Tom Warren writes for [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/tech/858505/pc-market-ram-nand-ssd-gpu-pricing-notepad) about "a battle over the future of the PC."

I stand by what I wrote about personal energy efficiency; gaming computers use a gross amount of energy and games are getting worse at harnessing that energy well. The math argument for cloud services checks out too: an RTX 5080 – the GPU class you get to borrow when you have a GeForce Now Ultimate plan – [costs as much](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1872786-REG/gigabyte_gv_n5080gaming_oc_16gd_geforce_rtx_5080_gaming.html) as almost **6 years** of streaming. But that might not be the case forever. Nvidia might get bored and ditch graphics processing to focus on building the [Allied Mastercomputer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Have_No_Mouth,_and_I_Must_Scream). Furthermore, GeForce Now has plenty of compromises built in that have changed *my* behavior around *my* hobby, which is worrying. Adapting to gaming on Linux has meant compromises caused by a lack of resources or focus by many, not the choices of one multi-trillion company. 

Owning a computer, one made with discrete, user-swappable parts[^3], is now more than ever a philosophical choice and a smart one, one that might be worth compromising on the logistical choices of personal energy efficiency and convenience.

So years after saying I’d never even consider spending hundreds of dollars on a new GPU, I’m anxiously trying to catch up on what the hell a 5060 Ti is and if it’s worth it to grab one now. It might push enough pixels to help me forget everything else that’s going on.

[^1]: Per this conversation of efficiency, huge kudos to the developers for working with an outside developer to [reduce the game’s size](https://steamcommunity.com/games/553850/announcements/detail/491583942944621372) by 85%, which is something I’ve never seen before and love!

[^2]: While I don’t disagree with the points raised, the tenor of the video and linked Reddit post sure do have that sweaty, “oppressed gamer” vibe I find laughable. Linking to a clip from Sydney Lumet’s seminal movie *Network* (1976), but it’s shit quality and has burned-in Russian subtitles, has dead internet theory vibes.

[^3]: I’m as excited about the Steam Machine as anyone, but integrated SOCs are not user-friendly in the same way as good ol’ sockets and spreaders. Insert long debate here about convenience and cost savings, post out that I’m writing this from an M4, whatever.
