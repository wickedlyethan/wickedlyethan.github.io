When I was ten, I was given a Sony boombox for my room. (This outraged my sister, who had to wait until she was twelve to get her Sharp stereo, which had a six CD changer! Younger sibling privilege strikes again.) Next I inherited my grandpa’s Sony compact stereo system; my dad trash-picked gigantic 80s plywood speakers and I hooked those up and used both speaker zones at the same time to blast Less Than Jake as I got ready for freshman year of high school.

Then when I was sixteen I used birthday money to buy my first proper stereo: A Sherwood receiver and Pioneer bookshelf speakers, all black. Despite the hiss in the cheap receiver, it was an amazing setup that I brought everywhere I moved for fifteen years. I still have it! I still love it. But my heart has been stolen, at least for a while, by another, and it’s a scandal.

The [JBL Flip 7](https://www.jbl.com/FLIP-7.html) is a small $150 Bluetooth speaker that we affectionately call the “sound burrito”. It’s an upgrade of the Flip 3 that Emily was gifted back in 2015 – it doesn’t use USB micro, which is by itself a huge improvement, but it also sounds better, lasts longer, and has a bunch of features I’m never going to use, like Auracast and “AI Sound Boost”.

The killer feature is one that isn’t in the manual and is relegated to far down the product page: plugging the Flip 7 into a device with USB-C enables lossless audio playback. No fussy Bluetooth syncing, no codec limitations, no positive and negative wires, no crunchy terminals. It “just works”, and it replaces twenty pounds of bulky, claustrophobic gear with a tube of simple sound.

Is the Flip as good as the old stereo? Heck no! The Flip has amazing engineering in its design and is capable of clear, punchy sound, but it’s at times a hollow and uncomplicated wall of sound; there’s not a lot of space or instrument separation. Physics are physics after all, and the entire Flip is a third of the volume of one of my stalwart Pioneer speakers.

But at this moment in my life, when I am trying to simplify my workspce, reduce the amount of stuff I own post-move, and am no longer tormented by constant horrible industrial noise and a tiny apartment, having a silly little speaker is a delight. I can take it anywhere while I tidy, or plug it in to my laptop when wearing headphones is overstimulating or vaguely depressing – wearing closed back headphones, alone, in a house, feels bad sometimes.

Someday I’ll go back to having a big honkin’ stereo, but I’d want to do it right and in an aesthetically pleasing way, which means, ironically, taking up even more space to put he speakers on stands and make the wires as invisible as possible. For now I’ve gone from a desktop JDS Labs Atom stack, a 20 lb receiver, and big speakers to a chi-fi dongle DAC and a sound burrito. For now, simpler is better; I’ve lost a lot of the urge to tinker and fuss. I’m confident I’ll get back to it someday. For now, I just need some jams.
