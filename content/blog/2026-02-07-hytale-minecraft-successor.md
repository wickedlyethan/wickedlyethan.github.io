I had an itch for another [two-week Minecraft binge](https://knowyourmeme.com/editorials/guides/what-is-a-two-week-minecraft-phase-and-why-is-it-so-common-the-viral-meme-explained) but, after wrestling with authenticating my Microsoft account with Prism launcher for twenty minutes, felt nothing when I booted it up.

Even after trying to come up with a new playstyle – I’ve had notes forever about a single-player Minecraft metaplay where you have to move camp every day and build signal fires at the highest point you can find, that kind of thing – I couldn’t get into it. I had installed optimization mods and shaders and data packs for the thousandth time and I wasn’t about to go data pack-diving to play [legally dubious Pokemon](https://cobblemon.com/en) or subscribe to a Patreon to download a random Java file and see if it works. I’m over the evergreen joke about spending more time modding a decade-old game than playing.

Instead I bought [Hytale](https://hytale.com/), which is $20 in early access but it’s hard to tell. From buying the game directly to authenticating the Linux-native launcher to jumping into your first world, the polish is admirable. Instead of fussing and fighting with it I started playing without a second thought.

I’ve seen the game referred to as “we have Minecraft at home” or “the ultimate Minecraft modpack”, but I don’t get why you’d say that with derision. Hytale obviously benefits from the cultural osmosis of Minecraft and other crafting survival games, but from the handful of hours I’ve put in it successfully disrupts Minecraft because it’s, in Sega terms, “doing what Minecraft don’t.”

Here’s an incomplete list of things that are in Hytale right now in early access but not in Minecraft:

- A map with waypoints and labels
- A compass with points of interest and map labels
- Clambering
- Inventory sorting
- A button to put things that are in your inventory into a chest if that type of thing is already in the chest!
- Multiple kinds of weapons, not just swords, with different playstyles
- Lots of avatar customization
- Block material blending
- Cutting down a tree at the trunk cuts down the whole tree
- A dedicated tool for changing the appearance of blocks instead of more blocks
- Toggle campfires and furnaces on and off
- Hover over slots in furnace or tanning rack UI to highlight what in your inventory can be used with it
- A simple bedroll item that can be crafted with the most common ingredients so you can set a respawn point early on
- Doesn’t look like dog poo

These “sensible defaults” reduce friction and honestly, make me angry at Minecraft for being stubbornly minimalist with basic features while blithely adding more and more blocks.

One of the most important differences is that the default world generation in Hytale has smaller biomes, rational caves, and way more structures, ones that make sense and mean something. Cave entrances appear in the top layer in a way that makes sense, and I can trust that they’ll go somewhere cool, not just end abruptly. I also trust that I can fumble my way back out thanks to the better movement mechanics, which means I’m more likely to take risks and go further into the depths. Hytale is “easier”, with less knockback when you get hit, every weapon being able to block hits, and admittedly brain-dead AI, but that means I’m having fun instead of dying and rushing back to my corpse over and over again.

Back above ground, orc-like creatures have camps with tents made of hide and carrots dangling over [pungee pits](https://www.polygon.com/videos/2020/9/6/21420064/tony-hawk-pro-skater-2-pungee-pit-investigation/); skeletons sit around campfires in abandoned forts; goblins sit on thrones above giant [piles of treasure](https://wand.com/wikis/hytale/Large_Treasure_Pile). There are temple-like structures with marble towers and golems in the basement guarding portals to another world. I’ve made one of these my home, putting down a campfire in the center of the overgrown chamber and building various workbenches around the perimeter. I put treasure and a pile of books I found at the base of the statue, an offering as thanks for letting me use the place for a while.

I could have picked a ruined farm or one of the skeleton forts, so I didn’t have to build a crummy cave with a door or a brutalist square cabin, though I can if I want. In Minecraft there’s no meaning or intrigue to a desert temple or village; they’re repositories for loot or variables to be exploited.

Once I had made some armor and found a halberd(!) on a dead goblin, I went into the basement and defeated the golem guarding a portal to The Forgotten Temple. A gorgeous pocket world full of critters with a statue in the center similar to the one in the home temple, the game reveals a mechanic of gathering “memories” about the creatures in the world by getting close enough to them – bringing those memories back to the statue unlocks rewards. It’s a simple mechanic, but it’s explicitly about seeing more of the world and discovering.

After a handful of hours I feel competent, but not industrious. It feels like I’m inhabiting this world, not stripping it and terraforming it on autopilot. We can chalk it up to novelty or streamlining, but I think it’s because Hytale feels less like a sandbox and more like an adventure. It wants to be played, it has things to show you. Hytale, unlike Minecraft for a long time now, makes me **feel** something.

Everyone likes rooting for the underdog and disrupting the complacent, stodgy, and ugly Minecraft is a great thing. There’s room for both in the market, but I know which one I want to play.
