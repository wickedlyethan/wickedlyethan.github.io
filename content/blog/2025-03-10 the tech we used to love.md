The [death of Skype](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/02/28/the-next-chapter-moving-from-skype-to-microsoft-teams/) made me think about all the technologies that millennials used for dating and relationships that no longer exist.

In middle school I once racked up a huge cell phone bill for the family because I was texting a girl I had a crush on every day during spring vacation. It was a Samsung flip phone that came free with our family plan and I was [T9 typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T9_(predictive_text)) all day until my thumbs hurt.

I resisted the call of early Facebook but we were on AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) most days once we got home and into the evening. Putting song lyrics in your away message was cool and moody, and people dating each would put matching lines about being "currently taken <3". I remember either catching up quickly between *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2* levels or sitting chin in my hand, staring at the monitor and the ominous "[so and so] is typing".

There's that one time I met a girl on [*Half-Life 2: Deathmatch*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_2:_Deathmatch) but let's not talk about that.

Meanwhile, so what if the 3G internet on your hand-me-down Blackberry Curve was slow as hell, you had to check if anyone posted on your Facebook wall! Woops there goes the family phone plan bill again.

When I met my wife I posted on her wall something "cool" every day. Every. Day. A link, a song, a web game; she revealed years later that it was endearing but "a bit much", which is fair. I had a first generation Chromecast and we used to sit on the couch and queue up song after song to the TV and that's how we learned what music the other liked.

Facebook messenger was the daily driver chat app and it sucked when it was inside the Facebook app, but then came [messenger.com](https://www.messenger.com/) (shocked that still exists) and the dedicated messenger app, which were honestly good! Messenger was fast, stripped down, and had big fun stickers we loved, like the [Facebook Fox](https://cargocollective.com/jaydefish/Facebook-Foxes), Bun, and Pusheen.

Much like phone design and the platform themselves, things stabilized and then calcified for quite a few years. Switching to Discord was automatic once I deleted Facebook and later Instagram, and now – as I [bemoaned the other day]({{< relref "notes/2025/2025-03-06" >}}) – it's the center of our social life. If cell service is shit we text, which thanks to [RCS](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/17/24246695/apple-iphone-ios-18-rcs-green-bubbles-android-upgraded) and matching Pixels is very good and we should use it more, but mainly it's all on Discord.

All this is to say that the tech we used to fall in love was  more romantic in a rose-tinted, janky way. There were useful limitations: you could *be offline*, you had to *sign in* to AIM or Skype, perhaps at a pre-appointed time filled with anticipation. There were sharp contrasts between them: Skype had incredible video quality, and even with our shit cameras it  was as close to verisimilitude as you could get; it was a big hit of dopamine to see the other person in crystal-clear 480p after days of texting.

And none of it can be replicated. Social media platforms are cyborgs, chaotically organic and ruthlessly artificial, which means they're all different today than they were ten years ago in functionality, design, and vibe. You can't "go back" to Facebook circa 2014 in any meaningful way, but you also can't even download AIM anymore and I can't even search for images of "GChat" because of the clusterfuck that has always been Google's messaging apps and services. (I got this far and didn't even think to mention **telephones**, which were a big fucking deal when you got one, hooked it up through the [DSL filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSL_filter), and made sure caller ID was working for your best friend or, gods willing, your girlfriend. I'm going to assume you don't have a landline.)

I'm extremely thankful to have dodged the epoch of dating apps, which have presumably changed intensely over the years and will someday shut down and disappear much like my beloved Skype, but the difference is that the above apps weren't made *for* dating, but they're where dating happened.

For four years my future wife and I were long distance (well across the state from one another, which we affectionately called "medium distance"), so we talked on Skype into the night, taking screenshots of dumb frozen faces we'd made when the connection dropped, and sometimes falling asleep by laptop light. Our low-res screenshots can't (and shouldn't) be preserved like love letters through history, but it does make feel some things that it's all functionally gone. It'll only get harder to explain as the years go on, and make it all sound even more improbable than it already was.
