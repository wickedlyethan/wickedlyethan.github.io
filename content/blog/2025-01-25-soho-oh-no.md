summary: I appear to be destined to go to New York once every 10 years. I just got back from my first proper Business Trip™️ and it was a weird and thankfully down-tempo experience. Not a lot of time, but plenty of thoughts on trains, main characters, clashing architecture, and big city budgets.

I appear to be destined to go to New York once every 10 years.

When I was ten years old we saw the Statue of Liberty and I tried out my new Nikon film SLR at the Bronx Zoo. I read the manual for the Playstation One game I was given on my birthday the whole way home, sitting in the way back seat of the family station wagon.

A decade later I went with my then-girlfriend, now-wife to a family wedding in Manhattan. It was on the side of the family with money, so it was swanky and black-tie and the first wedding I ever attended. We spent the day speed-running the Met and she was in brutal pain in tall heels for cocktail hour, but we laughed it off and danced all night.

A decade later again I just got back from my first proper Business Trip™️ and it was a weird and thankfully down-tempo experience. Not a lot of time, but plenty of thoughts.

## Trains, trains, trains!

I was genuinely confused when a manager asked when my flight was – what flight? We have a lot of blessings in central Massachusetts and one of them is the MBTA commuter rail, which is less dogged by troubles as the rest of the Bay State system and is automatically better than fighting traffic on any of the ring highways around the Boston metro area. Hopping on the commuter rail in -8°F cold wasn't great, but again, better than any traffic – I slept the whole way in.

From North Station at the end of the line (or the red line if you're awake to get off at Porter Square) you make your way to South Station for Amtrak and wait for your aged, forever under-funded steed.

And you know what? Amtrak *rules*, and that's before you get to the "I'm not paying for it" aspect (more on that later). No security theater bullshit in retro-fitted airports, big windows, quiet cars and *the* quiet car, way more space than any airline seat I've ever been corralled into. Our conductors were chill and funny when they got on the horn to tell us about "cool railroad stuff" or to announce we were running ten minutes early "because we're just that good".

The dream is to take the Amtrak up and across broad swaths of America, staring out the window and chilling the heck out, and the little taste of the Connecticut coast line from my full-height Acela aperture was great. The wi-fi was stable enough to get all the work done I needed to, then I read on my Kindle, gently swayed by the train hitting 140 MPH through New Jersey.

I could write a lot more about trains and how desperately I wish train culture were more prevalent in America, but suffice to say that flying to NYC feels offensive compared to the simplicity and comparative luxury of rail travel.

## New York, I hardly know you (not sure I want to)

On the topic of trains, I arrived at Moynihan Train Hall and needed to get down to SoHo, so obviously I just... do whatever the hell the MTA is.

Look, I bet it's great once you get used to it, but the big change from our humble MBTA is that every subway track in New York's subway is *multi-modal* – different trains running different routes use the same tracks, and you need to be careful to get on the right one, or you'll find yourself somewhere different from where you want to be, surrounded by a hell of a lot of Main Characters.

My perception of New York City is warped by culture and media and my dad who was a student and cabbie in the 1970s, but I did manage to see every stereotype imaginable in a few short subway trips. Guitar guys, thickly-accented men loudly harassing women, a preacher shouting the end-times next to a video billboard for generative AI, children being shoved ahead of folks re-selling Snickers, party speakers on wheels where no one asked for them, etcetera.

To quote an underrated *Jurassic Park* line, New York city "suffers from a deplorable excess of personality". My crabby New Englander mindset begged everyone to please, shut the fuck up, my fine *menshes*.

The mythology of places like NYC is that anyone can become someone, but the reality is that when moving through these spaces everyone should just *be*. (*Be* fuckin' quiet, ayyo)

## The skeletons of titans

As I was in the city for a very short amount of time – 1.5 days once travel was subtracted – my main activities were walking and eating delicious things, which are my second and third favorite things to do in cities after museums.

Walking around SoHo in 10°F through the cast iron district was the most interesting amble I had. The distinctive architecture, relatively untouched compared to the pervasive [AirSpace design](https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/3/12325104/airbnb-aesthetic-global-minimalism-startup-gentrification) of everywhere else, keeps the district's [rich and varied history](https://www.untappedcities.com/cast-iron-architecture-nyc-soho/) on the unpolished surface, which I appreciated. There's a command and respect warranted for the ornamental castings of classical elements grafted onto what once were titanic industrial spaces.

Nowadays the neighborhood is quaint and hopelessly bougie; the next day I did a loop around Hudson Yard where the towering glass towers filled with software and finance movers and shakers who don't really make anything at all. Even there you can find incredible moments of modernity clashing with history, and next time I'm there that's what I want to hunt; that energy fills me with insatiable curiosity and reminds me that the city was made by flesh and blood a long time ago, not cold grey suits recently.

## Got plastic in my wallet

Speaking of when I want to come back, the answer is "not in ten years, but no time soon either". The vibe is exhausting, even with natives attesting that congestion pricing has lowered   the tides every day, and the bedrock truth is that NYC is a lot more fun when you have funds to paper over the problems. This was a business trip and I was blessed with a company credit card, so my train was business class, my hotel room one block away from the office, and the daily food budget generous. If all this was coming out of my accounts, I'd be freaking out about min-max'ing my every step. A small of itinerary of museums and dinners could be brutal if you want to avoid the claws of tourists traps and travel time.

To wit; Moynihan Train Hall has no benches. None outside of the nightclub-loud food hall, that is. My legs aching from miles of rucking around the island, perpetually overstimulated by clashing clichés, I gazed in horror at this beautiful space peppered with travelers sitting on the floor and leaning, eyes closed, against pillars.

"Fuck that", I said, and lived long enough to become the villain, putting another $50 on the company card to gain access to the Amtrak lounge, where I now looked down on the people and listened to lizard lawyers on video calls while drinking a complimentary cappuccino. Peace and quiet had become a privilege with a price tag as concrete as the rest of the city.
