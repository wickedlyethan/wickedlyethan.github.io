I’m not a music writer so I’m not going to pretend to have analytical insight into Carly Rae Jepsen’s seminal pop delight *E•mo•tion*, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary with a deluxe reissue and a few new tracks, but I had to write about it. [Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/carly-rae-jepsen-emotion-10th-anniversary-edition/) has an excellent writeup that sets the table:

> ’80s pop rehashed for the new millennium feels staid in its omnipresence today—but remember when it actually felt like a bold new idea, when embracing that moment, in all its schmaltz and sentiment, could represent a genuinely surprising artistic turn?

I freaking love this album, and it stubbornly remains my favorite Carly Rae Jepsen work. It’s comfort music; it’s aspirational; it’s a constant source of inspiration. The huge, absurd saxophone notes of "Run Away With Me" are everything to me, a feeling I can't express any other way.

Jepsen writes almost singularly about love, but with myriad verbs and angles, scattershot and playful. She doesn’t just *want* love:

- she fights for it (“Every single minute / I’ll be your hero and win it”)
- she demands it (“Gimme love / Gimme touch / ‘Cause I want what I want / But with you it’s what I need”)
- she influences it (“In your fantasy, dream about me / And all that we could do with this emotion”)
- she’s impatient for it (“I wanna cut through the clouds, break the ceiling / I wanna dance on the roof, you and me alone”).

Jepsen even knows she’s a bit much about it! “Boy Problems” is a self-aware jam about how annoying it can be to listen to your love-obsessed friend mess things up over and over again. The massive hit “Call Me Maybe” (and its Tom Hanks-featuring [music video](https://youtu.be/qV5lzRHrGeg?si=5pDrKuwBDx9RADvO)) lets Jepsen indulge in poetry and simultaneously giddily give up on it: “I really, really, really, really, really, really like you / And I want you, do you want me? Do you want me too?”

Sometimes the more straightforward approach is the most fun and funny, and humor is part of the experience. “I Didn’t Just Come Here to Dance” is a trance-adjacent, campy dance virus with hilarious specificity:

> Hey, Joe's calling me over\
Tino is calling me over\
I only came here for you\
It's you, boy, you in the corner\
Something is taking me over\
I only came here for you

As for the new tracks on the reissue, the groove on “Move” is smoldering, and you can imagine the summer sweat that should accompany it:

> I'm afraid of the night\
I can see us burning down the horizon\
Dancing on the tip of the ice\
Tip of the iceberg\
You and me, I always had the feeling that there might be something\
More, more, more

“Guardian Angel” is a soaring, sweet track taking yet another angle on love, this time as refuge: “I wanna be your guardian angel / I wanna be your last call, babe.”

(The other two tracks and two remixes I could honestly take or leave, but that’s fine. I’m not going to pretend that Carly Rae Jepsen’s approach of long albums with tons of tracks has a 100% hit rate; I’d say “hit or miss”, but that doesn’t cover the dizzying heights of “hit” or the inoffensive nature of her misses. The tracks I don’t like aren’t my jam, but the tracks that are are anthems I’m here for ten years later.[^1])

The magic of *E•mo•tion* is that Jepsen is overwhelmed with herself and her love of love, and the album says “yeah that rules, let’s dance about it.” The romantic in me, the sappy dork who gets (hopefully affectionately) labelled a wife guy, is right there with her. All I can do is sing and dance along in the magic circle of earnestness.[^2]

(The irony, of course, is that my wife can’t stand Carly Rae Jepsen. What can I say, opposites attract.)

[^1]: Speaking of that reissue, a colorful double vinyl LP is in vogue, but can you imagine the beautiful jewel case CD this deserves? The anachronism of vinyl doesn’t do it for me. Relatedly, no artist advertises "buying" their album *other* than buying the vinyl, but you can buy this reissue in high quality from [HDTracks](https://www.hdtracks.com/#/album/68eda29967105208d5ecbc0c) or [Pro Studio Masters](https://www.prostudiomasters.com/search?q=Carly+Rae+Jepsen#quickview/album/410804).

[^2]: At risk of being inflammatory, that earnestness is refreshing compared to the current slate of pop starlets. Contemporary Taylor Swift, where you can’t help but see the machine behind her, with nakedly strategic re-releases and endless content; Tate McRae with her Victoria’s Secret brand of implacable horniness; or Sabrina Carpenter’s vaudevillian rabble-rousing. Jepsen is here for the love of the game.
