summary: Grappling with the results of the election the only way I know how. Turns out that all our holier-than-thou assumptions are, and have been, wrong. There aren't more of us than them; facts don't win over lies; the arc of history does not appear to bend towards justice, if it ever did. We are the shrinking minority.

The greatest horror to me this morning is that Donald Trump won the popular vote. Kamala Harris got 15 million fewer votes than Joe Biden did in 2020.

That means that all our holier-than-thou assumptions are, and have been, wrong. There aren't more of us than them; facts don't win over lies; the arc of history does not appear to bend towards justice, if it ever did. We are the shrinking minority. Never again can we say "this isn't who we are", because the sacred electorate has made its voice heard.

He didn't have to pull legal fuckery or cheat or mobilize his forces in some horrific way. He didn't win on an electoral college technicality, which would be a valid reason for fury. He won because more people wanted him to be president, and everything that entails, than anyone else. Oh and they won the senate and the governorships, too.

It doesn't feel worth it to dig into the ethnography of the results, or to start casting blame for failed strategies; it doesn't matter.

Now it comes in waves, each worse than the last. The downstream effects are both unknowable and laid out on pages and in HD video, from the mouths of their future executors. Each one is separately mind-boggling; in aggregate it's beyond recognition â€“ all of Project 2025 is on the table now. More than ever it's hard to swallow the mealy-mouthed optimism about the on-the-ground work that keeps democracies moving.

And now we have to go to fucking work. I'm writing this because writing about it is the only way I'll process it, and there's a lot to process. It's all just the beginning.
