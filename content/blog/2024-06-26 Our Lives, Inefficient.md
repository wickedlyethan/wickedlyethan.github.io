title: "Our Lives, Inefficient"

Technology Connections is one of the best YouTube channels out there, and his latest videos about [dishwashers](https://youtu.be/jHP942Livy0?si=cT7MdmLSH5E6fDT1) and [HVAC units](https://youtu.be/DTsQjiPlksA?si=bVKErR12Q0iMK12b) are compelling, thorough examinations of some of the most vital parts of our homes. As the host mentions at the top of the dishwasher deep-dive, "I'm apparently the internet's weird appliance guy!" You are, and we're all thankful for your service.

The work that Technology Connections is doing is part PSA, part diatribe against bad design and manufacturing; he always sides with the user and imagines a world in which our tools do the work for us better by being more efficient.

"Efficiency" has become somewhat of a boogeyman in our lives and discourse. Unlike when thinking about "efficiency" in our work lives ("hacks") or domestic lives ("organization tips"), there is an obvious "to what end" when thinking about energy efficiency – less energy usage is good for you (your wallet), good for your community (less strain on the electrical grid), and good for the planet (you know the drill).

Approaching things from an energy efficient mindset has great downstream effects too: a countertop oven pre-heats a lot faster than a traditional oven and doesn't warm the whole damn place; kettles and induction stoves boil water faster than anything else; LED light bulbs are brighter and can do more than any incandescent ever could. All these examples need less maintenance, which grows more important as tradespeople shortages continue, likely for a long time as a knock-on effect of society deciding colleges should be massively profitable and American education should be built around funneling everyone into them.

In other words, I think energy efficiency is the *only* way one should be thinking about efficiency, because every other variation is a trap. There's no such thing as mental, productive, or emotional efficiency. Efficiency is the realm of machines until we touch them.

Modernity is life at scale, and many of the basic inefficiencies we deal with every day are almost rational responses to having to serve that scale – your dishwasher, fridge, and stove were the cheapest your landlord wanted to buy and the retailer sold them at a bulk discount, for example. Being able to push back against these defaults is a function of privilege and resources – and a touch of neurosis, for me at least – but I think everyone should be thinking in this mode if they can.

Moreover, we should be actively working to change the attitudes around energy efficiency. In a recent video, John Green proposes ["Beef Days"](https://youtu.be/lzWlrARDVbQ?si=coTTeM9uHenA-Fwz), where in an effort to reduce beef consumption, we as a society make it a celebratory occasion to indulge in everyone's favorite red meat. We (my wife and I) practice this, in that certain foods are classified as restaurant-only: steaks, hamburgers, scallops (that's just because they're a pain in the ass). The looks we get from family about this can be alienating, and Costco would really like us to buy 6 pounds of ground beef for a suspiciously good price.

If then, as [Hank Green](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P29gknBaUqc) puts in his reply video, social norms are a kind of technology that must be used wisely, then I'm making the call to shift social norms towards making being energy efficient cool as fuck. That requires both elevating the practices of trying not to be grossly wasteful out of dweeb-ish academia, and also some naming and shaming. For the rest of this piece, I'm going to do said naming and shaming of the things and practices that drive me insane looking at our lives, inefficient as we're letting them be.

I'm not some kind of saint in this regard, as should be obvious by default. I am striving to be better, and there's a balance to be had between the comforts and progress modernity has wrought us and living on [a freaking boat with a 2010 Macbook](https://100r.co/site/about_us.html). Maybe that equivocating discounts everything I'm about to write and have written, but hey dude, it's my blog.

## We're (not) gonna need a bigger fridge

Like most things in American life, our fridges are super-sized and needlessly so. Refrigeration accounts for about 4% of the electricity budget in a home, but it dovetails with another huge resource problem: food waste. The average American household wastes [6 cups of food a week](https://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/513977/helping-america-solve-food-waste-problem.aspx) and 36% of food produced gets thrown away. There are huge systemic issues that contribute to the latter, but the former is a household management problem, and we know that people instinctively buy and keep things to fill their available space.

The best-selling fridge on BestBuy's website is [18.6 cubic feet](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/insignia-18-6-cu-ft-bottom-freezer-refrigerator-with-energy-star-certification-stainless-steel/6467055.p?skuId=6467055), and Whirlpool Corporation, a massive conglomerate of home appliances, [says that](https://www.whirlpool.com/blog/kitchen/guide-to-refrigerator-sizes-dimensions.html)  "as a rule of thumb", you need 4 to 6 cubic feet of fridge space per person in the home, or about 20 cubic feet for a family of four.

Not to uncritically compare ourselves to Europeans/the UK, but appliance companies like [AEG](https://www.aeg.co.uk/taste/discover/buying-guides/fridges/) and [LG](https://www.lg.com/uk/lg-experience/helpful-hints/standard-fridge-sizes/) claim that what you need for a family of four is between 200-300 liters, or about 7-10 cubic feet *total* for a family of four. Less than half! (Bonus, LG UK has an entire category dedicated to "American" style fridges, which are massive and start at 635L, or 22 cubic feet.)

Obvious complicating factors here are cultural differences around buying smaller amounts of food more often, having fewer "super" markets and more smaller grocers on corners (that, shockingly, you might be able to *walk* to!), and food that has fewer preservatives and other junk in it, but my point here is that by wanting to save energy by having a smaller fridge, one might also waste less food, have a smaller appliance for your probably too-small kitchen, and maybe even think critically about meal planning in general.

This paradigm, of choosing more energy efficient options leading to good downstream effects, is what I'm jabbering on about. Imagine if all our appliances were appropriately sized for our households: a 2 bedroom apartment coming with an 8 cubic foot fridge, 2-burner induction cooktop, and a countertop oven. We'd be using the correct amount of energy to do the correct amount of work; imagine how much simpler things would be. If commonplace complex tools – appliances – are civilization, then we're wielding them poorly.

## Prometheus wants to land at Tilted Towers

Apple silicon's greatest miracle is its power-per-watt – an M1 Mac Mini, [for example](https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/28/m1-mac-mini-power-consumption/), sips 7 watts while idle and can gently glug 39 watts of power under load. It's also very fast and plenty for most people.

The best-selling laptop from BestBuy is a Dell Inspiron 15 with a "Intel 12th Generation Core i5" processor – once that processor is arduously revealed to be an [Intel i5-1235U](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/226266/intel-core-i51235u-processor-12m-cache-up-to-4-40-ghz-with-ipu/specifications.html), we can see the processor alone has a minimum total power draw (TDP) of 15 watts. Does this make it a wildly inefficient machine? No, but the benchmark has been set and every manufacturer should be aggressively chasing after it, at all price points. (I also guarantee that computer kind of sucks – it's a $500 Dell laptop, enough said.)

But computers for normal people are one thing. The use case that has been giving me pause lately is my unfortunate pass-time of PC gaming.

The most popular GPU per the [Steam Hardware Survey](https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/) continues to be the NVIDIA RTX 3060, a card praised for its power efficiency with a TDP of 170 watts maximum. You can't buy a power supply for an ATX desktop under 500 watts, and it's common knowledge that you need more than that.

My desktop, running a beleaguered i5 9600k and RTX 2070 Super, have a combined TDP maximum of 310 watts. Lately, launching a modern game at 1440p makes both of those components redline to 100% or near it, so let's go ahead and assume they're using that amount of power, and that's before the other components in the system.

The question that keeps intruding on my gaming sessions is this: all this, ***for fucking what***? *Fortnite* is not a very good video game, and I haven't been enjoying it lately; *Helldivers 2* is pretty good, but not life-changing, though it is the only co-op experience I have on standby nowadays (RIP *Overwatch*); *Halo Infinite*  runs smoothly enough and is damn good, leading me to think it's the most efficient of the three, even as I set the quality settings to "low" to get the most frames; *Baldur's Gate 3*'s infamous third act brought said system to its knees, so much so that I stopped playing because performance problems were giving me visual migraines.

To bring it back to the former section, my gaming computer is using as much electricity as our over-sized refrigerator, full of delicious food that keeps me alive, to play games I'm enjoying but not overjoyed by, at kind of shit quality settings, unreliably.

The future, I hope, is promising for this problem: Apple seems to be remembering to care about games again, and Windows on ARM may enable some laptops to play games without a GPU at all. My Steam Deck plays many games at 15 watts or less, and my retro emulator handheld gets multiple hours of pre-PS1 gaming with a tiny 3500 mAh battery. Perhaps the answer is to "reject modernity" and play old games, but keeping friends around might get tough when there's no incentive to [keep older multiplayer games around](https://www.pcmag.com/news/epic-games-to-shut-down-servers-for-unreal-tournament-rock-band-games).

Proper PC gaming wants to move into the cloud, which brings efficiencies of scale but also horrid excess and a future of not owning software, so that's a tough one to crack. I'm not sure that's the best answer. It would be nice if the console makers didn't continue their spec war towards "4K" gaming (in scare quotes because of AI-upscaling tech required to hit those resolutions anyways), and made games that scaled better across devices and displays.

As for regular people's computing, I hope that all specs fall into the background compared to performance-per-watt – we need laptops that can run for hours and hours and put out very little or no heat at all, and I think we're mostly there with new computers; your grandmother's $300 open-box Acer, probably not so much. This all assuming you need a traditional-paradigm computer, and not just an iPad or phone to do what you need to; if that's you, bless your soul as you live a simpler life than I.

Goodness knows too that the software we force these things to run are the animating devils of it all; apps like Chrome, Slack, Teams, and Discord are all horribly optimized, battery-draining garbage. If everything is going to forever be Electron apps, we're not going to get anywhere, and that's before the hell that awaits us in the "AI"-in-the-OS nightmare.

In the meantime, I'm using my Windows desktop as little as possible and plugging my M1 Macbook Air into a dock when I need the peripherals; my work laptop is an M3 Max Macbook Pro and even corporate bloatware can't  wreck [its impressive efficiency](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/testing-apples-m3-pro-more-efficient-but-performance-is-a-step-sideways/). (My corporate workload, like almost all corporate workloads, is mostly a browser with lots of tabs.)

## Hanlon keeps his apartment at 78°

Air conditioning is one of the most powerful technologies humanity has ever created. It is an objective good that has saved lives and will continue to do so. It's also enabled the folly of building [cities in the fucking desert](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/07/phoenix-climate-drought-republican-politics/678494/) and people use it stupidly.

The other day I woke up to a lovely June day in Massachusetts, the mercury at a lovely 72 degrees Fahrenheit at 7 AM. **Every single air conditioning unit in our complex was running at full blast.** The cacophony  was deafening, the waste of it staggering. Assuming that those apartments are set to a frigid 68 degrees – which, to be as charitable as possible, is the higher end of the range that Google returns as the "optimal temperature" for sleep, so let's say that the SEO mills are right – that's a temperature differential of 4 degrees. Tens of thousands of watts cumulatively to cool their homes from pleasant to supposedly perfect.

At every lunch hour there are cars in office parks running their engines to cool the cabins for lonely office workers on their phones. Said offices inflict ["Women's Winter"](https://youtu.be/d2NNm8MTboA?si=EsBNryOFVbbpkG0f) upon everyone because no one cares to think critically about whether everyone in the cubicle farm is a [six-foot man wearing a wool suit](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/science/chilly-at-work-a-decades-old-formula-may-be-to-blame.html).

This feels like madness. [Hanlon's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor) would lead me towards this wanton air-conditioning being ignorance, but my mind reels at the idea of someone not even having a trickle of global warming anxiety. Not everyone read the first chapters of [*The Ministry for the Future*](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/kim-stanley-robinson/the-ministry-for-the-future/9780316300162/) and couldn't sleep for a few nights, but *come on*.

So yeah, my spicy take is that air conditioning should be freaking rationed. You shouldn't be able to cool your home past a certain differential with the heat index, not only because it's wasteful and environmentally disastrous, but because it's fucking stupid and loud. The people who have air conditioning use it poorly, and those who need it don't get it.

I could talk myself out of this for another thousand words with sensible sensitivities and endearing empathies, but no. The atomization of life under late stage capitalism (he said the thing!!) means we all put our personal comfort first; the same impulse governs CEOs and regular folks in our landlord-special apartment complexes, the former just won't suffer any of the consequences. And to be clear, because surely it must be clarified, those [57 companies](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/04/just-57-companies-linked-to-80-of-greenhouse-gas-emissions-since-2016) should be held responsible **with extreme prejudice**, but that doesn't make you not a dick for blithely wasting resources, and nihilism isn't a free pass.
