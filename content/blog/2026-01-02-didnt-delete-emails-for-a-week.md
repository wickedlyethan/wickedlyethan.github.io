I’m an inbox zero person out of compulsion. This is possible because compared to insufferable productivity gurus or people who run a business, I get what is a normal amount of email. Which is to say, still too many! 

As an experiment I went the week without deleting any emails, letting them pile up in the inbox, to see if there were any patterns of note. Spoiler: I didn’t make it seven days. I barely made it a business week. (To be fair it was the last week of the year, not a typical week of email, but illustrative nonetheless.)

I received 138 emails in five days, about 28 a day, at all times of day. It starts at 6:30 AM or so and continues at a staccato throughout the day until 9 PM. I wish they’d come in proper clumps; I’m reminded of the rose-tinted days of the morning and evening broadcasts, long before I was born.

Gallingly, **half** of all emails I received were from non-profits and charities I **already donated to**. I'm fortunate to be in a position to donate to charities but this feels like a punishment. Never mind the dark patterns of manipulative subject lines and sender aliases, this is flooding the zone. The ACLU sent three emails **a day** this week – including “urgent announcements” and a byline from Robert De Niro, yippee. This doesn’t make me want to donate more, shockingly.

Everything else paled in comparison, but getting reminders to submit surveys about every online order I’ve made in the past month, marketing to use services I pay for (shut up, Netflix!), marketing from companies I bought one thing from years ago, or ever seeing the word "LinkedIn" was unpleasant.

The cognitive load of seeing these emails pile up, seeing if I needed to read them now or not then letting them sit regardless, felt way worse than rapid-fire deleting them, though I did find myself checking my inbox fewer times because it became even more clear that none of it mattered.

Takeaways:

1) I’d love to gate email checking to certain hours, maybe by finding a decent email app on macOS that has useful badge compatibility or notifications that can be time-gated.
	- [Mimestream](https://mimestream.com/) looks lovely but is only for Gmail; [Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com/) advertises four separate AI products on the homepage which feels gross; [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/) feels like ancient technology and I can’t find many positive things said about it.
	- None of these options even make sense per item three of this list; privacy-focused email options require using their own apps or workarounds to maintain security, which does make sense.
2) In addition to a round of standard pruning, I need to unsubscribe from every non-profit, no matter how much I agree with their mission, to keep my sanity.
3) I need to look into a privacy-focused primary email address. The problem there is managing multiple email addresses is itself a logistical problem to solve. Do I have multiple tabs pinned and open? Do I try to cultivate discipline about checking them only so many times a day? Who knows. Not me, not yet.
	- Picking a privacy-focused email service feels extra fraught. The plan would be to open a Proton Mail or Fastmail account and then transition only the important accounts to them, which means you’re adapting your workflow using the most critical services. That sounds nerve-wracking! How do you pick the “right” service for something so important?
	- From a digital minimalism / ease-of-use standpoint, breaking the “loops” of opening and closing tabs is one of the most important tools in shaping your behaviors. This is explicitly adding a destination, which I try to avoid.

I encourage you to try this experiment too, and ruthlessly unsubscribing. Clearing out your inbox is good and all, but turning down the noise is more productive in the long-term.
