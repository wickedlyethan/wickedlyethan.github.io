I’m an inbox zero person out of compulsion. This is possible because compared to insufferable productivity gurus or people who run a business, I get what is a normal amount of email. Which is to say, still too many! 

As an experiment I went the week without deleting any emails, letting them pile up in the inbox, to see if there are any patterns of note. Spoiler: I didn’t make it seven days. I barely made it a business week. (To be fair it was the last week of the year, not a typical week of email, but illustrative nonetheless.)

I received 138 emails in five days, about 28 a day, at all times of day. That doesn’t sound too bad, but **half** of all emails I received were from non-profits and charities I *already donated to*. I am fortunate to be in a position to donate to charities but this feels like a punishment. (The ACLU sent three emails **a day** this week – including “urgent announcements” and a byline from Robert De Niro, yippee.) Never mind the dark patterns of manipulative subject lines and sender aliases, this is flooding the zone.

Everything else paled in comparison, but getting reminders to submit surveys about every online order I’ve made in the past month, marketing for services I pay for (shut up, Netflix!), and seeing the word "LinkedIn" was unpleasant.

The cognitive load of seeing these emails pile up, seeing if I needed to read them now or not then letting them sit regardless, felt way worse than rapid-fire deleting them, but I did find myself checking my inbox less because it became even more clear that none of it mattered.

Two takeaways:

1) I need to gate email checking to certain hours, maybe by finding a decent email app on macOS that has useful badge compatibility or notifications that can be time-gated.
2) In addition to a round of standard pruning, I need to unsubscribe from every non-profit, no matter how much I agree with their mission, to keep my sanity.
3) I need to look into a privacy-focused primary email address. The problem there is managing multiple email addresses is itself a technical problem to be solved. Do I have multiple tabs pinned and open? Do I try to cultivate discipline about checking them only so many times a day? Who knows. Not me, not yet.
