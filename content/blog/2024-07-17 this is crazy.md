File this under "a rant", but if I was ruler of the universe, I'd ban 75% of meetings. [*The Atlantic*](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/07/white-collar-meetings-more-frequent/678941/) writes that a Microsoft study found that "workers in their sample have *tripled* the time they spent in meetings" – emphasis theirs. 

An even bleaker sentence precedes that one:

> About one-third of the workers in their study were as likely to work at 10 p.m. as they were at 8 a.m. The reason? When the pandemic sent knowledge workers home, official meetings replaced casual interactions and made it impossible for many people to get things done unless they found time to log back online after dinner.

That's **fucking insane**. Apart from the obvious moral outrage of working well past your contracted hours – of letting the bullshit of modern "white-collar" work bleed all over your precious, minimized personal time – is this not clear evidence that this shit doesn't work? 

I'm confident we all agree, but feel we can't do anything about it. In my experience – exacerbated recently – I've noticed an interesting, pernicious culprit: no one wants to take responsibility for making a decision. 

Meeting after meeting, hour after wasted hour, is spent trying to come to a consensus about every single detail instead of a leader gathering information from their experienced cohort, making an informed decision, and then telling someone to do it.

Pretty weird that I'm advocating for top-down structure when I hate toiling under late stage capitalism and have worked hard to make my role as autonomous as possible, right? I don't think so, and here's why: people above me get paid more to have more responsibility, and they should have to make decisions that they then answer for. I'm not here to make decisions, I'm here to execute decisions with my knowledge and skills – that's goes for most people[^1].

Are said decision-makers going to fuck up and make bad decisions, forcing you to do more work? Yeah, maybe, but when they do mess up, by being human or by Dunning-Kruger effect, I'll have to clean it up. My job at that point, in my mind, is to figure out the fastest, least-miserable way to get it done. I'm damn good at that.

So yeah, have a hierarchy. Listen to your experts. Tell them to do stuff. If they're telling you the best thing to do is something incompatible with what the team or organization needs, then you've got other problems.

All this is before we even get into the basics of [asynchronous communication](https://calnewport.com/should-this-meeting-have-been-an-email/) or [fancy communication standards](https://www.axioshq.com/research/smart-brevity-communication-checklist) or automating [low-quality but necessary comms](https://slack.com/apps/A0L6ELY4E-standup-bot). How about first we get someone to make a damn decision first?
