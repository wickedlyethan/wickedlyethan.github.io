subtitle: 'Greek tragedy (in Italy), the best cozy fantasy, and a couple of timeless reads got me through the year.'
summary: I've moved past doing a yearly reading goal, but I read 29 books this year and it was a pretty good, if not amazing selection! Books like *Glorious Exploits* by Ferdia Lennon, *Bookshops & Bonedust* by Travis Baldree, and *Annie Bot* by Sierra Greer were my favorite new releases.

I've moved past doing a yearly reading goal, which is slightly ironic because I've also transitioned from Goodreads to [The Storygraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/) and it offers way more data, but I read 29 books this year and it was a good if not amazing year. In 2023 I gave 40% of the books I read total four stars out of five; this year it's a much wider spread, to the point it almost feels petty. As much as I like having the flexibility in Storygraph to give increments of stars, it feels like I've gotten a bit fussy with it.

That doesn't mean I didn't read great books this year, and I'm glad I did more reading and less gaming and scrolling, for example. What follows are my top 5 for 2024!

## *Glorious Exploits* by Ferdia Lennon

The premise here feels too clever for its own good: Two Syracusians put on Euripides with a cast of Athenian prisoners of war, but it's written with contemporary British/Irish anachronistic language. Our protagonist but not hero is Lampo, a rude jerk with a heart of gold for his friends, riding the rollercoaster of his own brash decisions as he tries to stage Greek tragedies with his moody literature-obsessed friend Lampo. *Glorious Exploits* is a expertly written tragicomedy I devoured in a weekend.

The deliciously flawed premise – what happens to these starving and slowly dying actors after curtain call? – gets kicked down the road again and again by our directors until its too late, and the consequences sent me reeling even as I knew they had to happen, a trademark of the tragedies the two of them crow about with admiration while missing some of the important points.

## *Bookshops & Bonedust* by Travis Baldree

Baldree quickly proves that *Legends & Lattes* wasn't a fluke and that the niche sub-genre of "cozy fantasy" has legs. He also competently defeats a host of prequel problems, using our knowledge that Viv has to leave the seaside village of Murk against us by filling it with lovable characters and solid adventure that is cleverly book-themed. 

Baldree understands there has to be stakes to the story, and they can't only be between Viv and the foul-mouthed bookstore owner Fern nor the cautiously warm baker Maylee. Both of those plots are well done and well rewarded, smartly demarcating that "cozy" doesn't mean "childish". What *does* it mean? I think there's plenty of room for interpretation and Viv's adventures don't need to be the blueprint, but they are the best show of form so far.

## *Annie Bot* by Sierra Greer

This was an exercise in being constantly uncomfortable. By being committed to Annie's perspective, Greer's novel forces us to confront the horror and discomfort of her situation as she is developing the intelligence and understanding to process – or try and process – it. Her spiraling thought trains always come back to her owner, and every thought she has for most of the book is framed as "how would Doug feel about that?" It gave me the creeps, as did every person's interactions with Annie, especially the blasé repair technicians dialing in her sexuality or sculpting her body all to Doug's capricious, mercurial customer feedback. 

It's not a subtle book but its execution is consistent and arresting, and can be seen as a more thoughtful, appropriately-scaled counterpoint to HBO's *Westworld* – what if the androids had feelings but about things that actually mattered?

## *The Giver* and *Number the Stars* by Lois Lowry

Neither of these books came out in 2024 obviously, but I had to include them because they were undoubtedly my favorite books I read this year, and two of my new favorites of all time. Lowry is a master of her craft, and these stories of young people inheriting unfair worlds are written with a sparse, deft hand – every word is precise and unflinching, not cruel but confident and caring: *I need you to understand*.

One could write thousands of words about each of these works and their timeliness (and timelessness), but my re-read of them – decades after I think I read them for class, I can't even remember – feels private and special. I started the year on a high note with these, curled up in my reading chair like the world was simple again, until Lowry gently reminded me that no, it's not, and it's our duty to embrace that complexity with all that we are capable of.
