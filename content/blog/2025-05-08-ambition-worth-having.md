subtitle: I have a bullshit job, and I bet you do too. What if we made that uncool?

Rutger Bregman did a [great interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKBIET9kMw) on “The Daily Show” where he lays out a simple case for “moral ambition” (the idea and his book): check your privilege, then use it to do good. People who have college degrees *should* be held to task about choosing to spend their time in what he calls the “Bermuda triangle of talent”: the useless trifecta of finance, consultants, and corporate law. They *should* be worried that their job is, per anthropologist David Graeber’s 2018 book on the subject, [bullshit](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/34466958-bullshit-jobs).

I felt attacked in the right way by this interview because I *know* my job is bullshit. What’s worse is I left a previous job that *wasn’t* bullshit because my new employer doubled my pay after years of scrapping for a wage way under market rate. It was a moral surrender to get access to a paycheck that has stabilized my future and enabled me and my family to be healthier and happier. Why the fuck did I feel that was the only choice? Every kid dreams of growing up to be something cool, and before it’s beaten out of them, useful to society. Astronaut, marine biologist, zookeeper, inventor, adorable answers when you’re six. Then [“wake up you need to make money”](https://youtu.be/pXRviuL6vMY?feature=shared) happens and our ambitions are lowered, and keep spiraling down from there.

I want to read *Moral Ambition*, but it seems safe to put it alongside Graben’s *Bullshit Jobs* and Eric Klinenberg’s *[Palaces for the People](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/557044/palaces-for-the-people-by-eric-klinenberg/)*, works that call for moral clarity against oligarchical capitulation and late-stage apathy. A [“I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it anymore”](https://youtu.be/rGIY5Vyj4YM?feature=shared) but about trains, school supplies, libraries, and bridges. Even the even-keeled Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, in their new book *[Abundance](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Abundance/Ezra-Klein/9781668023488)*, advocate for being angry about how long it takes to do anything around here. They want to give wonkiness a PR makeover and embrace being tactical instead of simply earnest, and I like that a lot.

The [United States Digital Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Digital_Service) (USDS) was created by Obama to make better government digital services in the wake of the disastrous healthcare.gov launch. They fixed healthcare.gov, redesigned the VA website, established a [consistent design system](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) for government websites and made one of my [favorite fonts ever](https://public-sans.digital.gov/), among other much more important tasks. The mission of the USDS was to get people out of big Silicon Valley tech giants and into the government, even if only for a limited time, to make things work better. I say “was” because the USDS has been gutted and destroyed by DOGE, which established itself like a blood-sucking parasite inside USDS and [destroyed it](https://apnews.com/article/doge-elon-musk-federal-government-resignations-usds-6b7e9b7022e6d89d69305e9510f2a43c).

When I heard about USDS years ago, I put in a pin in it – what a great idea, I’d love to do something like that. When I applied for jobs a few years ago I tried to find something in a local municipality – maybe I could I help modernize things, make better communications to the people on a small scale. I ended up working in biotech for three years, writing technical documentation for a novel way to detect the probability of Alzheimers over time, and I felt great – except that we were writing scientific documents in Microsoft fucking Word and I was getting screwed. When I left for my current role, my manager sighed in the way that says this happens all the time. It wasn’t his fault, he was a great manager. It wasn’t entirely my fault either; the company was toxic and tanking itself, there was no world in which a lowly technical writer got a raise worth anything.

I can say now it was my fault that I jumped ship into a new job with zero moral ambition at all. I stepped away from even pretending I gave a shit, and I regretted it quickly but let the scab heal. Now the scab has been picked off, and I’m not sure what to do about it, but I’d like to think I’m a person who will do something to make civic service cool, someday. That’s an ambition I’d like to have.
