![Oh yeah, I had to include the graph](/images/blog/2025-11-10-starting-over-my-second-brain.png)

I try to be the most laid-back Obsidian evangelist out there. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is an incredible app that I’ve made my “second brain” for four years. It’s a note taking app where everything is in plain text using Markdown syntax, so you own the data and can take it anywhere you want and do whatever you want with it. I cannot recommend it more, especially in contrast to walled gardens with blunt tools like Apple Notes or Google Keep or Google Docs.

In my Obsidian vault I’ve written about travel plans and dreams; every camera I own and their specs; how I like my tea and coffee; reviews of every TV show I watch; documentation for my [homelab]({{<relref "/blog/2024-10-05-my-new-homelab.md">}}); how to use tools like iPerf, ffmpeg, Vim, Exiftool, and more; takeaways from dozens of [How to ADHD](https://www.youtube.com/c/HowtoADHD) videos; musings about online life and Linux and iOS and browsers; outlines for novels and design docs for games; my monthly life review; and much more.

It currently sits at 223 notes and 275,000 words. I started in 2021, and four years later it’s a sprawling but tightly organized cabinet of thoughts I needed to have and refer to but couldn’t trust my squishy sieve of a brain to hold onto, hence the “second brain” moniker.

And then I deleted it.

Okay, I didn’t delete it – I zipped it up, tucked it away, and started from scratch. An empty vault. No folders, no organization system, no complicated naming convention. *Tabula rasa*.

Why the heck would I do that? My second brain had ceased being a vibrant, elastic workspace and had calcified. It became rigid and cramped to the point that new notes rarely happened if ever, and continuing thoughts in notes that were as long as *New Yorker* profiles felt ineffective and clumsy. Trains of thought – plenty of them – had been pleasantly exhausted, and there was nowhere to go but they hung around in the way. There’s a cognitive load to opening an app and seeing *everything you ever wished to remember* in one place.

So, a new vault for 2025 and beyond. I used Obsidian’s excellent [Bases](https://help.obsidian.md/bases) feature to query my vault for notes I had created in 2025 – few, sadly – and brought the ones over that I  wanted to keep working on, dumping them straight into the root directory. I brought over my [configuration folder](https://help.obsidian.md/configuration-folder) to retain my few beloved plugins (see below), but I changed the theme from the default (why did I use that?) to the excellent [Flexoki](https://github.com/kepano/flexoki-obsidian) vibe.

Since then I’ve been taking notes on all sorts of things – how to de-Google my life, a shopping list for new camping equipment, ideas for aggressively compartmentalizing my work life, takeaways from great articles I’ve been reading – and choosing the zen life of not organizing anything at all. It’s just a bunch of thoughts hanging out.

Or a better way to think of it, as influential designer [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/) does, is a digital garden full of little seeds. My previous second brain was an old-growth forest, the canopy stifling the activity below, so it was about time for a wildfire. Some of the new ideas and thoughts will grow, some will whither, but it’s a fresh ecosystem now.

## Known problem: evergreen notes

All that said, there is reference information in my original vault that will never be irrelevant, so I need to figure out a way to put so-called evergreen notes somewhere within reach *and* out of sight. Not sure what that is yet; maybe it’s a dedicated evergreen vault?

## Appendix: Digital productivity people scare me

Listen, I like Cal Newport plenty and Oliver Burkeman’s [*Time Management for Mortals*](https://www.oliverburkeman.com/fourthousandweeks) was an eye-opening read for me, but real productivity nerds scare me. I don’t want your [Zettlekasten](https://zettelkasten.de/overview/) or your [Johnny Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com/) or your [PARA](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/). I don’t do obsessive backlinking or establish [“hierarchical taxonomies”](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes) or call it “knowledge work”. Maybe if I were into these systems I could [Lucy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2872732/) the shit out of life but I find these frameworks exhausting and pretentious. If they work for you that’s all that matters, but I don’t think anyone should think of them prescriptively. The majority of the time I want to have thoughts, not have thoughts about the right way to have thoughts.

## My favorite Obsidian plugins

- [Advanced Tables](https://github.com/tgrosinger/advanced-tables-obsidian) (working with Markdown tables sucks. This makes it a bit better.)
- [Obsidian Linter](https://github.com/platers/obsidian-linter) (we LOVE a linter.)
- [Typewriter Scroll](https://github.com/deathau/cm-typewriter-scroll-obsidian) (the correct way to work with text. Should be everywhere.)
- [Hider](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-hider) (Obsidian is very clean. Make it cleaner.)
