It's only been three years since the brain damage of [*Jurassic World Dominion*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8041270/), but here we go again. 

Gareth Edwards is directing, presumably because he was able to bring the luscious-looking but horrifically written [The Creator (2023)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11858890/?ref_=nm_flmg_job_2_cdt_t_1) to life with a tiny budget and some really smart filmmaking. *Jurassic Park* and *The Lost World* screenwriter David Koepp is back, but that's not a guarantee of quality either – he hasn't written a solid movie since *Spider-Man*. The one from 2002. His 2020 novel [*Cold Storage*](https://coldstorage.davidkoepp.com/) was fun and in a traditional Michael Crichton vein, but I don't remember much of it which is as much a review as I can give. Meanwhile 2017's *The Mummy* and 2023's *Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny* both carry his credit and therefore part of the blame. Both were attempted reboots of beloved adventure franchises. [insert cartoon "gulp!" sound effect here] Also, Scarlett Johansson is here for some reason.

Let's dig in:

From the fade in we're in worrying territory – the fluttering banner scene from the original *Jurassic Park* was epic but on the nose in the way that only Spielberg can get away with. This callback is not cute. It automatically makes no sense – if this is a museum exhibit on the mainland, why would it use the original marketing collateral from a theme park that has ended in disaster not once, but twice? Our Museum of Science doesn't have exhibits about corporate malfeasance massacres.

Jonathan Bailey looks thrilled to be here and is giving his character life and energy that bring the hope meter back up. Next to Scarlett Johansson, who post-*Jojo Rabbit* has stiffened up and toned it down in a way that doesn't capture the screen, he's who I want this story to be about. The billing order says otherwise.

Mahershala Ali doing a dollar-store version of *The Lost World*'s "isla de muerta" scene in a beret is a perfect encapsulation of the silliness that has made these movies bigger and dumber over time, trading *pathos* for... uhhh, certainly not *logos*, so really trading it for nothing. Sucking oxygen out of the room and out of our brains, really.

Wait we're literally doing *Jurassic Park 3* again? "This island was the research facility for the original Jurassic Park"- motherfucker, we saw the research being done on Isla Nublar and in JP2 we saw the "backup" island Isla Sorna, are we going to keep spawning in islands?

Charles Pulliam-Moore for The Verge [correctly called out](https://www.theverge.com/trailers/606484/jurassic-world-rebirth-trailer-premiere-date) that this synopsis, as given by Scarlett in yet more weirdly-edited VO, makes this movie into a video game. `Collect 3 Dinosaur DNA specimens` can go in the HUD in the top-left corner.

Halfway into this trailer and I'm feeling my mind start to shift and bend in ways I don't like but might help. Our heroes appear to be in a Tomb Raider level: a stone temple carved into a mountain, complete with carved animal heads and a perfect beam of light onto a dinosaur nest. This is... fun? The whip sound effects are fun, Scarlett kicking a dinosaur is fun, our scientist lad getting yeeted out the template entrance from whence he came is fun!

> Please don't say they're raptors.\
They're raptors!

^ This is a funny line, but something has gone wrong in the edit. It sounds like Jonathan Bailey is saying "they're rape-tors!" which is Not Good.

We're going with on this yet-another-island the "worst of the worst" dinosaurs, the real freaks, were "left here". That's really dumb, but I see what they're going for, which is an excuse to leave all science behind and make whatever monsters they want. Honestly, fine.

**Seriously, why the fuck is there a kid here.**

Scarlett yelling "DUNCAN!" – who the fuck is Duncan? It's Ali? Sure! Who put that line in there? Was that one of the shots where the color timing was finished? How am I supposed to trust a movie's structure if its trailer can't get information reveals right?

I guess we're going to need a bigger boat! There's good stunt work going on at least. Name-dropping the Mosasaur is a bad idea, because if there's any single dinosaur in this franchise that breaks the rules of "no really they're in our world now", it's the Mosasaur. Thanks to some real ones over on [Stack Exchange](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/189351/how-large-exactly-is-the-mosasaurus-in-jurassic-world) we know that as presented in a trailer for *Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom*, the Mosasaur is the size of a **blue whale**. In what world does any world government allow that to exist in open water? Having the dinosaurs land-locked was the best thing this franchise ever did, and breaking that rule was a huge fuck up.

Ok, that's the trailer! "Rebirth" is a weird title. It's not full ick but it does make me vaguely uncomfortable.

In the [Vanity Fair reveal](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/jurassic-world-rebirth-first-look) for the movie, Gareth Edwards says some weird shit that feels like missing the point:

> The thing that scared Edwards the most was living up to Rebirth’s predecessor, which he feels has been disguised as family-friendly fare over the years. “*Jurassic Park* is a horror film in the witness protection program,” Edwards adds.

There's a ton to unpack there, probably another 1,000 words, but I don't think I even need to go there – the *Jurassic Park* I love isn't even dead, it never really lived as far as "the franchise" is concerned. We had our one beautiful summer (before I was born) and that's it, now I really have to stop fussing over these things becoming so shockingly stupid. I think I have more to say but at this moment I'm deflated.

What's that? Oh yeah, I'll see it.
