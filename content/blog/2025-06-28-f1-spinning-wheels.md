subtitle:  Car go very fast. Brands very large on screen. These dudes are real jerks. Cool I guess?
summary: 'Remember how *Ted Lasso* spent a lot of time and energy making its roster of rich twenty-something footballer fuckboys likeable and human? *F1: The Movie* doesn’t bother with that, or much of anything that would make it a story worth telling, instead putting out on the track the most maximalist sports movie ever made; every time you might get bored or remember for a moment how shallow and crass it all is, it has the easiest distraction ready: *let’s do another lap*.'

Remember how *Ted Lasso* spent a lot of time and energy making its roster of rich twenty-something footballer fuckboys likeable and human? *F1: The Movie* doesn’t bother with that or much of anything that would make it a story worth telling. Intead it puts out on the track the most maximalist sports movie ever made; every time you might get bored or remember for a moment how shallow and crass it all is, it has the easiest distraction ready: *let’s do another lap*.

I don’t know a lot about F1, and the only fan I’ve encountered is a complete douchebag who wears a black-on-black baseball hat with the F1 logo indoors on video calls, so I went into the cineplex expecting a 6/10 by-the-numbers sports movie with technical chops and a dash of Saudi propaganda. I even assumed the movie would be preposterously up its own ass about the sport: *F1: The Movie*  inescapably wields the sport’s official logo as its own, and superstar driver Lewis Hamilton is a producer on the film, casting himself as the villain to beat in the final race.

I didn’t expect the movie to simply not bother with convincing us of anything. There’s jargon and a lot of talk of tires, but piloting a formula one car doesn’t look too difficult after these 141 minutes; the secret is to show up, be great at racing already, crash the car, and do it all over again – it happens multiple times. The drivers’ athleticism and skills are never in question, they were born to drive and nothing else, they don't need to get better. Brad Pitt’s dollar store Maverick has an injury from thirty years prior that suddenly becomes a problem in the climax, but as Ryan George would (will) say, “super easy, barely an inconvenience!” Our main leads agree that they’re both assholes, and they don’t stop being assholes; they direct their asshole-ry at other people, together. Great job? The regular sports movie mechanics make token appearances here but are quickly thrown aside like used-up parts of the car.

By midway through I couldn’t help counting the logos on the car, helmets, jumpsuits, billboards, and more. Every frame is bought and paid for, and my screening included a pre-trailer crossover ad for KFC right after one for GPL-1 injections. Apple, cringey co-producer of the movie, sent millions of people an [urgent push notification](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/24/apple-wallet-notification-f1-movie-ad/) to get out there and see Brad go. The stunning technical work, the sheer Herculean production effort onscreen, can’t distract from the lack of compelling humanity. The laps are blisteringly fast and visceral and remarkably legible, but there are *a lot of them*. It all becomes blandly lame; our hero fighting for himself, sometimes his team, and Expensify.

- Kerry Condon is the most charming person here and I hope her residuals buy her a beautiful beach house.
- Tobias Menzies hams it up as a villain with a plan I literally don’t understand, but he can’t penetrate the veil of inhuman blandness.
- We’re supposed to root for Javier Bardem because he’s going to lose ownership of his team – his really, really bad team – and these watches won’t pay for themselves.
- Annoying similarly to *Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning*, the movie feels bicameral in its film language, like the stunt team filming the racing were the true filmmakers and whoever got stuck with dialog scenes was an understudy. Frame-filling close-ups by default and bland wides to show nothing at all. Downright unpleasant to watch two people talk.
- I think my disappointment comes from the worry that director Joseph Kosinski’s triumph with *Top Gun: Maverick* (2022) was a fluke. That movie is deeply earnest, specific, and frankly there’s a lot more virtue in flying fighter planes than racing F1 cars narratively.
- It's clear the filmmakers were given tons of access to F1 – again, the movie's logo is the offical logo of the sport – but I'm reminded of Nilay Patel's comment on the recent [Tesla robotaxi launch](https://www.theverge.com/tesla/694333/tesla-robotaxi-media-influencers-musk-fans) on the Vergecast: "Access is poison". Imagine a version of *F1: The Movie* where they could actually be mean, be critical, even just make jokes at the sport and its fans' expense?
- Honestly, just go watch [*Ford v Ferrari*](https://letterboxd.com/film/ford-v-ferrari/) (2019), I beg of you. Bonus points if you watch it with your dad, who will love it.
