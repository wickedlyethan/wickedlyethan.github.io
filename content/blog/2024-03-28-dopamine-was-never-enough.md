title: Dopamine Was Never Enough

In the latest issue of [*The Convival Society*](https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/), L.M. Sacasas responds to Ted Gioia's essay ["The State of the Culture, 2024"](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/the-state-of-the-culture-2024), and they both have interesting thoughts on distraction and technology use. I like both and also disagree with them, and I wanted to get some thoughts down.

Let's take a look at the source essay first. Gioia, in his frank style, makes the argument that distraction is subsuming all other forms of culture, and that the peddlers of said distraction are a "dopamine cartel", solely focused on creating users who are addicted to the low-quality content on their platforms. Fair enough, I think we can all agree with that second point - session time is the most important user metric for platforms, and [dark patterns](https://www.vox.com/recode/22351108/dark-patterns-ui-web-design-privacy) abound.

(Gioia proclaims the arrival of a "post-entertainment" culture, one that will decimate "the arts" and society at large. I think he uses faulty reasoning here. The examples he gives are not of the art failing us, or us failing the art, but of the industry failing the art and artists. No wonder the writers and actors went on strike; soon [everyone else in Hollywood](https://variety.com/2024/artisans/news/iatse-teamsters-strike-rally-hollywood-1235925985/) might too.)

Meanwhile in ["Desire, Dopamine, and the Internet"](https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/desire-dopamine-and-the-internet), Sacasas generously investigates Gioia's claims and is uncomfortable with the label of "addiction", instead using "compulsion" and trying to dig at why we even enjoy compulsive technology use in the first place:

> The dopamine framing at once tells us too little and also claims too much.... Do we keep coming back because we are addicted or because we imagine that we have no better alternative or no good reason not to? What are the underlying fears and aspirations that might be driving our compulsive relationship to digital media?

Important to note that both Sacasas and Gioia use "digital media" and "distraction" vaguely; the latter calls out "doomscrolling, trolling, doxxing, gaslighting, etc." alongside TikTok and Meta products. Sacasas only refers to "internet use". I think it's fair to say that what we're talking about are large algorithmic platforms, the atomic action of which is scrolling, the [worst way to interface with a computer](https://twitter.com/rogerclark/status/1664035617091751936).

By pointing out the simplistic nature of the dopamine framing, and the "addiction" framing, it feels like Gioia – and many others, many times across literature about compulsive technology use – are reducing us to input-output machines, our most simplistic understanding of computers themselves, to try and understand our frighteningly intimate relationship to them. With this framing, one might feel that dopamine is the only output of our lives we feel we have control over, and that drives our scrolling. Of note, is that dopamine is not an output at all, but a byproduct, so the metaphor doesn't map. (Arguably one of the greatest tragedies of scrolling in this way is that there's no output at all.)

Sacasas refutes the dopamine framing and wonders if we are scrolling to avoid thinking deeply about ourselves; he wonders if we as a society have become "deskilled in the practice of solitude". I wouldn't say I disagree with his set of points – we aren't good at being bored, and we don't want to think critically about ourselves, but to his own point this problem has been around since the mid-seventeenth century philosopher he quotes, Blaise Pascal. Pascal writes about a king "surrounded by persons whose only thought is to divert the king and to prevent his thinking of self. For he is unhappy, king though he be, if he think of himself."

Here's one notable difference: most of us aren't surrounded by persons to divert us – we're staring at them through black glass rectangles, and I don't think that's the same thing, not when we're seeing an ["epidemic of loneliness"](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf). And we're not kings. Sacasas touches upon this, being what I think is overly generous and finally ascribing our scrolling to a deeply base human need: "we desire to know and to be known."

Here then is where I disagree with Sacasas: technology as facilitated by Big Tech, aka the engines of Distraction as examined by both of these authors, fucking sucks for knowing or being known. We long have known about the [90-9-1 rule of the internet](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/participation-inequality/), but there's no reason to assume those conditions will continue with the unchecked proliferation of generative so-called "AI"; the [Dead Internet Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory), when not taken at its literal conspiracy definition, observes that most of what we see is regurgitated dregs of that aforementioned 1% or the newly ascendant content bot armies.

In other words, most people don't post anymore, and to scroll is to know nothing. I would then argue against Gioia that what we're "addicted" to, agreeing with Sacasas that that term might not be appropriate, is not dopamine, but *anesthetic*. By scrolling we see horrors and drivel in equal parts, and we're so used to it that it doesn't register any more and that's the best part, the most successful function.

In the dumbing down of our own psychology by using the dopamine framing, or the elevation of the problem into personal moral crisis, lies the tools of our distraction, if you will. If we simply seek input and the only output is dopamine, then we've been trained to compulsively use technology until we hit stack overflow; if we're only trying to avoid thinking about ourselves then the solution is to log off and start journaling.

Here then, is the other part I disagree with Sacasas on:

> For my part, if I have a disordered relationship with the internet, I know, in the immortal words of Jimmy Buffett, that it’s my own damn fault.

He continues:

> In a culture of information superabundance, we need above all else the discipline to say “no” or to set limits upon our engagement with the vast proliferation of digital media. But the anti-cultural spirit has left us ill-prepared to say “no” to anything.

The real product of Big Tech and algorithmic newsfeeds is further [atomization of society](https://erraticus.co/2020/03/11/atomized-generation-community-atomization-loneliness/), one of the great goals of Late Stage Capitalism. (He said the thing!! Put it on your bingo cards!!) They're not just some companies that figured out how to "hijack" our biology, they are adversaries. They haven't manufactured an "anti-cultural spirit", they've created a reality in which many people have no better recourse than to retreat from it entirely.

Setting limits upon our engagement is one idea, but how about we break up Facebook? Adopt something even slightly resembling comprehensive privacy laws?  Enact any number of policies or strategies to make life better, and us therefore less "distractable"? If anyone is going to log off, it should be everyone, and there has to be something better waiting for them when they do.
