subtitle: “I’m not what you are, and not what you intended.”
summary: ‘Thunderbolts’ isn’t what you think it’s going to be, and that’s a good thing. It doesn’t make it a good movie. Trigger warning **and** spoilers!

**Trigger warning** for suicidal ideation and **spoilers warning** for the following review! And fair warning, I don’t give a shit about comics.

Let's get the bad out of the way first.

*Thunderbolts<sup>*</sup>* (no I’m not writing the asterisk every time) is a weird, most likely inconsequential entry to the MCU. It begins and ends and the one Big Thing that’s changed – the “Thunderbolts” team is suddenly, unceremoniously re-branded “The New Avengers”, with fancy suits, overdone makeup, and a rebuilt Stark tower – is hard to wrap your head around. What does it even mean? It feels like a BBC *Sherlock*-level joke at the audience’s expense, chiding them for caring about the thing that you make. Disney’s reflexive self-hatred for its classic material and now the Infinity Saga of 2008-2019 is alienating, pitiful, and I’d be so bold as to say disrespectful.

I hate Julia Louis-Dreyfus in this movie and every second she’s on screen is immersion-breaking agony. Geraldine Viswanathan is wasted as her right hand.

There’s elements of the usual MCU pastiche: clunky exposition, bad quips about superhero names, and a single joke that is carried through like it’s funniest shit when it isn’t. Here it’s that a major character is named “Bob”. That’s it, that’s the whole joke. (Bob is played by Lewis Pullman of previous “Bob” fame from *Top Gun: Maverick* (2022). Is that funny? No.)

Here’s where it gets weird: *Thunderbolts* is **also** a thoughtful, if not subtle, movie about the dangers of suicidal ideation; about the longing for easy, permanent answers; about how important it is to find the light in yourself and the people around you. As someone who has wrestled with anxiety and depression my whole life – and struggled with it acutely very recently – this hit like a sack of bricks. It felt... good. It was “handled” well, meaning it felt authentic, complicated, and valuable. It’s dark as hell and true.

The movie opens with Florence Pugh’s Yelena explaining, not asking, that something is wrong with her. That her life doesn’t feel valuable, that she’s alone, and that she’s burnt out at her job and feeling no purpose.

Later Yelena explains:

> Yelena Belova: ...I'm so alone. I don't have anything anymore. All I do is sit, and look at my phone, and think of all the terrible things I've done; and then I go to work, and then I drink, come home to no-one, then I sit and think of all the terrible things I've done again and ag–

(It’s worth noting that her job is slaughtering people, and there is a bizarreness to making her the “heart of the MCU” at this time. She’s a person, but she is a genuinely bad person. She’s no longer under the control of the Red Room, she’s chosen to keep being a murderer. What does it say about us that we keep making teams of anti-heroes? *The Boys*, *Suicide Squad* (both of ‘em), *Birds of Prey*, now this. The simplest reading that comes to mind is we believe anyone can do good things, but that no one is actually good. Bleak stuff.)

Our villain, Bob/The Sentry/The Void, forces people to relive their worst moments when he touches them, and later becomes a man-shaped, vantablack wraith and flattens innocents into charcoal smears in a notably chilling way. (Another tonal note about later MCU: lotta child endangerment going on here! Flashbacks to the Black Widow training, a little blonde girl getting erased in front of our eyes. Bleak stuff.) It’s a lot of evocative imagery, followed by a surreal exploration of Bob’s mind and past. The climax blessedly avoids “shouting at the primordial evil” as a resolution and instead has our heroes tear Bob away from his darkest self and hold him tight, Yelena whispering that everything is going to be okay, “we’re here for you.”

It makes me wish *Thunderbolts* wasn’t an MCU movie at all, because it’s a well-delivered and poignant message for a middling genre movie caged by a spitball-and-twigs cage of franchise. It’s okay for these things to be *about* something. I encourage it.

Other notes that didn’t make it into the review:

- Good soundtrack by Son Lux.
- Wyatt Russell is a great screen presence. He’s the best part of the uneven [*Monarch: Legacy of Monsters*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt17220216/) and the only thing I liked from *Falcon and Winter Soldier*; he still feels unpredictable and I love that.
- Damon Lindelof’s [“have to save the world”](https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/12/4613532/damon-lindelof-interview-hollywood-blockbuster-screenwriting) rule is in effect again, because *Thunderbolts* is a small movie until The Void threatens New York (again). 
- Speaking of which, fuck you for literally redoing the drywall on Stark tower and handing it to Dreyfus’ awful character and then to the “New Avengers”, who themselves are baffled that it’s still there. Again, these symbols have meaning.
- Speaking of which, among the weird and sort of mean-spirited revisionism about the earnest MCU’s past, Bucky is looking tired and makes multiple jokes about being old. Let him rest and stop questioning why people liked this stuff in the first place. Spoiler: it was because superheroes were heroes.
- Shout-out as always to the stunt coordinators and fight designers, there’s plenty of great choreography in this.
