![My pretty pile of banned books](/images/blog/2025-04-10-banned-books.jpg)

I had the pleasure of putting in a giant order to our wonderful local indie bookstore – [The Silver Unicorn in Acton, MA](https://www.silverunicornbooks.com/) – to celebrate Banned Books Week 2025 *and* to donate books to the middle school library my wife works in. I was giddy picking up not one or two books but a *box* of them – the picture above is half the order – because I love shopping at my local businesses and I love buying books, especially when it's righteous.

I had a few objectives with this slew of frequently censored novels:

1) Upgrade copies of classics that we own as crusty, unpleasant mass market paperbacks. I can't stand reading these with their stiff binding, tiny Times New Roman, and cramped layout. I prefer to have beautiful copies of good books![^1]
2) Stock up on controversial classics that I felt we "should" own[^2]. I'll be the first to recognize the cliché canon of this selection, but there's a lot of reasons they're relevant; just check your news feed.
3) I have barely ever ["weeded"](https://www.ala.org/tools/challengesupport/selectionpolicytoolkit/weeding) my personal book collection, humble as it is, and now that we've settled into our new apartment it felt like a great time to do so.
4) Celebrate Banned Books Week!

[Banned Books Week](https://bannedbooksweek.org/) has been happening since 1982 "in response to a sudden surge in the number of challenges to books in libraries, bookstores, and schools", which have only gotten worse: 2023 hit a [new record](https://uniteagainstbookbans.org/2024-book-bans/) for the number of unique titles targeted (4,240), largely by rabid “serial book challengers". A *Washington Post* analysis summarizes that “the majority [of book challenges] were filed by [just 11 people](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/05/23/lgbtq-book-ban-challengers/)”.

I don’t feel the need to dissect the stupidity of said serial challengers, who we can conclude are mentally unwell, unserious people. Instead I’ll point you towards [Let Freedom Read Day](https://bannedbooksweek.org/let-freedom-read-day/) and a great list of actions big and small you can take to fight censorship and support banned books. You can send emails, patron your local bookstore, or more. Anything is better than nothing! The theme this year, wouldn’t you believe it, is [“Censorship Is So 1984. Read for Your Rights.”](https://www.ala.org/bbooks/banned)

On a lighter note, I want to exalt my love for bookstores and libraries: Emily and I met working at a Barnes & Noble; I go to my local library at least once a week for peace and quiet and to take out five or six books a month; we are blessed with multiple local bookstores nearby, and though I have a tier list they’re all special and vibrant places. I hope someday I’ll see my own name on one of their shelves, but now I’m being saccharine. They’re just books, right?

[^1]: If I wanted to be pedantic – and I do – I’d point out that the copies we got are more modern and better typeset but still cheap printings with soft, bruise-able paper. On the one hand these keeps them at accessible, commodity prices – no one can afford to stock their shelves via [The Folio Society](https://www.foliosociety.com/usa/) – but it’d be nice to trust these to stand the test of time; it’s ironic, even.

[^2]: Of these I haven't read *Brave New World* or *Fahrenheit 451*, the latter of which is ironic, so it's coming up soon! Not pictured is *Wuthering Heights*, which technically is for Emily so it's going in her bookshelf, but I want to give it a shot.
