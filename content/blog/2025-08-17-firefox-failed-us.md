The other day I investigated a [Tumblr post](https://www.tumblr.com/ralfmaximus/791886234381385728/some-users-report-firefox-scoffing-cpu-power) accusing Firefox of implementing LLM features that were causing spikes in CPU usage and aggressive battery drainage. The [article](https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/13/firefox_ai_scoffing_power/) linked is of dubious quality, as are others I could find on the subject ([OMGUbuntu](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2025/08/firefox-high-cpu-usage-inference-disable), [Neowin](https://www.neowin.net/news/mozilla-under-fire-for-firefox-ai-bloat-that-blows-up-cpu-and-drains-battery/)); both rely on a [single Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/1mle0ql/mozilla_please_for_the_love_of_god_please_do_not/?sort=top) that’s now been deleted. A [more recent thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/1mp960y/firefox_ai_feature_causes_cpu_spikes_why_users/?sort=top) links to a [guide article](https://www.maketecheasier.com/firefox-ai-feature-causes-cpu-spikes/) that offers no source for its claim that Firefox’s new AI features are abusing resources.

It doesn’t matter. The LLM chatbot is there, ["AI-enhanced tab groups"](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-use-ai-enhanced-tab-groups) are lurking under the hood. As naive as it is to type, the point of using Firefox was to be smugly superior to the Chromium sheep, to get away from some of the big-tech bullshit and support the little guy. The second I opened `about:config` and had to flip little switches to bat away LLM anything I didn’t ask for, the illusion was shattered.

Maybe it should have been shattered earlier, like when sponsored search results showed up in the address bar or on the default home page; when Mozilla shuttered [Pocket](https://wickedlyethan.com/blog/2025/05/out-of-pocket-out-of-mind/) after diluting its usefulness for years; or when it became clear that Mozilla exists [at Google’s pleasure](https://www.theverge.com/news/660548/firefox-google-search-revenue-share-doj-antitrust-remedies):

> Firefox makes up about 90 percent of Mozilla’s revenue, according to Muhlheim, the finance chief for the organization’s for-profit arm — which in turn helps fund the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation. About 85 percent of that revenue comes from its deal with Google,  he added.

Being forced out of platform lock is a repeating pattern of tech in the 2020s and it’s a good thing, but it’s also disruptive and frustrating when good tech is supposed to make our lives easier. As web browsers have become the most important app on our computers of any size they’ve gotten worse, and at worst are pipelines that suck up every crumb of our information.

I now have to think about whether my browser is betraying me or not, and look into alternatives like [Waterfox](https://www.waterfox.net/) or Kagi’s [Orion](https://kagi.com/orion/). Someday there’ll be a great artisanal browser to buy, one hopes, but even there will be no ethical internet browsing under capitalism.
