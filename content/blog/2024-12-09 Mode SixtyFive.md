Mechanical keyboards are a fussy proposition from the start – honing in on the minute interactions between bits of plastic, springs, and all the industrial materials that hold them together – but then again, the keyboard is *the* tool of the information age. "Knowledge workers" use keyboards all day long, and as with many objects in the Anthropocene, once you notice how shit most of them are, you can't go back into the cave. You can, however, try to save money inching your way out of said cave, but the Mode SixtyFive has shown me the folly of that way of thinking. It's frequently worth spending the money on a nice version of the thing you use all the time.

I've owned and used 6(!) mechanical keyboards since 2020 when I got my first, slowly climbing the ladder of cost and trying out different layouts and materials. On the one hand, I got to try a lot of different bits and bobs, on the other hand I did a lot of extra work to end up spending more, each time choosing not to have control over every aspect of the boards to save cash. I bought mystery switches from Novelkeys, a warehouse build from the now-defunct TheKeyCompany, and an on-sale Keychron for the office even as I was desperately trying not to go to the office. If it can be categorized as a journey, it was a frustrating one and a fool's errand – by trying *not* to be a blind consumer and spending over my internal willingness-to-pay, I bought more!

All this to say that I'm willing the Mode SixtyFive, a stunning 65% mechanical keyboard with an intense amount of customizability, to be my "endgame" board. I adore the choices I've made for it and I really don't want to make any more choices about keyboards, please. Let me rest in peace with my stunning, thocky, keyboard I spent too much on.

- Mode SixtyFive v2 keyboard
  - Black aluminum case with walnut wood accent
  - POM plate
  - Full lattice mounting blocks
  - Full case and plate foam
  - Mode Obscura long-pole linear switches
- Osume Night Market keycaps, using the "luminous orchid" and "brilliant yellow" accent keys

Keyboards are hard to write about because of the aforementioned fussiness and subjectivity in feel and sound, but to me my Mode SixtyFive sounds like what a keyboard "should sound like". The long-pole switches are higher pitched than traditional "thocky" sound, but the case foam cuts off the highest end of that sound and deadens them into a pleasing middle ground of "thock" and "clack" and a shorter travel, which sounds like writing late into the night in a room with only one lamp on.

I've embraced walnut and black as my personal favorite color combination for my desk area – it's understated but natural, un-opinionated but vaguely academic, and lets color accents pop like the art on my wall or the accent keys on the board. My last keeb was a garish silver and that was what broke the spell for me – the keyboard is the central tool of the space and, in my opinion, should set the tone, not break from it. I'm minimalist-ish, but I need enrichment for my enclosure, that's why my Escape key is a smiley face. :)

Despite all I said at the top, I ordered the SixtyFive because it was on Black Friday sale for 20% off, because I still couldn't justify spending the full price on it, but it was and is worth every penny. The build experience was easy, well-documented, and immensely satisfying to do from scratch; every component is well engineered and crafted – the quality is in every plate, piece, and screw. (Hell even the included screwdriver is high quality.) I'm putting a keyboard in the same category as mattresses, shoes, and tires – if it goes between you and the world around you, it's worth spending the money to do it right.
