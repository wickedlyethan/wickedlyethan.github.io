- 4 pound (2kg) whole chicken, at room temperature giblets and neck removed from cavity*
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter, (melted)
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/4 cup white wine, ((OPTIONAL) -- use a dry wine like a Sauv blanc or Chardonnay)
- 1 lemon, (halved)
- Salt and freshly ground pepper, (to taste)
- 2 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley
- 4 garlic cloves, (minced)
- 1 head of garlic roughly peeled and cut in half horizontally (through the middle
  crosswise)
- 3 fresh whole rosemary sprigs
directions:
- Preheat oven to 430째F | 220째C (400째F or 200째C fan forced). Line a baking tray with

- Discard neck from inside the cavity and remove any excess fat and leftover feathers.
  Pat dry with paper towels.

  over the chicken, under the skin and inside the cavity. Season chicken liberally
  on the outside and inside the cavity with salt and pepper. Sprinkle over the parsley.

  chicken and under the skin.
- Stuff the garlic head into the chicken cavity along with the rosemary sprigs and
  the squeezed lemon halve. Tie legs together with kitchen string.
- Place breast-side up into baking tray or roasting pan. Roast for 1 hour and 15-20
  minutes, basting half way through cooking time, until juices run clear when chicken

  Serve, drizzled with pan juices and remaining lemon half cut into wedges or slices.
