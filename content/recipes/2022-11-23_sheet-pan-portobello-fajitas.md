ingredients:
- 1 Tbsp chili powder* ($0.30)
- 1/2 tsp chipotle powder ($0.05)
- 1/2 tsp onion powder ($0.05)
- 1 tsp cumin ($0.10)
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder ($0.05)
- 1 tsp sugar** ($0.05)
- 1/2 tsp salt ($0.03)
- 2 portobello mushroom caps ($3.99)
- 2 bell peppers (any color) ($2.29)
- 2 yellow onions ($0.64)
- 3 Tbsp olive oil ($0.38)
- 8 small flour tortillas (6-inch) ($1.00)
- 1 avocado ($1.09)
- handful cilantro (optional) ($0.25)
- 1 fresh lime ($0.59)
directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400ÂºF. In a small bowl, stir together all the ingredients for
  the fajita spice mix
- Slice the portobellos, bell peppers, and onions into 1/4 inch wide strips. Place
  the sliced vegetables on a large sheet pan. Drizzle the olive oil over the vegetables
  then sprinkle the fajita spice mix over top. Use your hands to toss the vegetables
  until everything is well coated in oil and spices.
- Roast the vegetables in the fully preheated oven for 40 minutes, or until the vegetables
  are slightly wilted and the edges have a nice brown color. Stir the vegetables half
  way through the roasting time to make sure everything gets even exposure to the
  hot air.
- After removing the vegetables from the oven, squeeze fresh lime juice over top.
  Sprinkle chopped cilantro over the vegetables. To serve the fajitas, scoop a small
  amount of the roasted vegetables into each tortilla and add a slice of avocado.
