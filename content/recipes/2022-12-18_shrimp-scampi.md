ingredients:
- 4 garlic cloves, 2 grated, 2 thinly sliced
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 1 pound large shrimp, peeled, deveined
- ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- ¼ cup dry white wine
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
- ¼ cup (½ stick) unsalted butter
- 3 tablespoons chopped parsley
- Warm crusty bread (for serving)
directions:
- Whisk grated garlic, salt, and 1 Tbsp. oil in a medium bowl. Add shrimp, toss to
  coat, and chill, uncovered, at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.
- Heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium and cook shrimp mixture,
  being careful not to let shrimp or garlic brown, until shrimp is pink but still
  slightly underdone, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to a plate with a slotted
  spoon, leaving as much oil in pan as possible. Add sliced garlic and red pepper
  to skillet and cook, tossing, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add wine and lemon
  juice and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Add
  butter and cook, stirring and swirling pan occasionally, until butter is melted
  and sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes more.
- Scrape shrimp along with any accumulated juices into skillet. Toss to coat and cook
  until shrimp are fully cooked through, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a platter, top
  with parsley, and serve with bread for dipping alongside.
