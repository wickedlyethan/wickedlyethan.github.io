ingredients:
- 1 lb. ground pork ($3.49)
- 1 large egg ($0.21)
- 1/4 cup breadcrumbs ($0.07)
- 1 cup BBQ sauce, divided ($0.54)
- 1/2 tsp salt ($0.02)
- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika ($0.05)
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder ($0.02)
- 2 cups chicken broth ($0.26)
- 2 cups milk ($1.25)
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder ($0.02)
- 1 cup quick cooking grits ($0.49)
- 1/4 tsp salt ($0.02)
- 2 Tbsp butter ($0.18)
- 1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper ($0.02)
- 1 cup shredded cheddar ($1.15)
directions:
- Preheat the oven to 375ÂºF. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
- Add the ground pork, egg, breadcrumbs, 2 Tbsp BBQ sauce, salt, smoked paprika, and
  garlic powder to a bowl. Use your hands to mix the seasoning into the pork until
  everything is well combined.
- Divide and shape the pork mixture into 16 meatballs about the size of ping pong
  balls. Place the meatballs on the prepared baking sheet.
- Transfer the meatballs to the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until browned
  and cooked through.
- While the meatballs are baking, prepare the cheese grits. Combine the chicken broth,
  milk, and garlic powder in a medium saucepot. Place a lid on top and bring it up
  to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally to prevent the milk from
  scorching.
- Once boiling, stir in the quick cooking grits and salt. Turn the heat down to medium-low
  and let the grits simmer for about 5 minutes or until thickened, stirring occasionally.
- Remove the grits from the heat and stir in the butter and pepper. Next, stir in
  the shredded cheddar, one handful at a time, until fully melted into the grits.
- Once the meatballs have finished baking, add them to a clean bowl and pour the remaining
  BBQ sauce over top. Stir to combine. The heat from the meatballs will warm the BBQ
  sauce. If your BBQ sauce is cold from refrigeration, you may want to heat the meatballs
  and sauce in a saucepot over low for a few minutes.
- To serve, place about one cup of the cheese grits in the bottom of a bowl. Top with
  four meatballs and some of the BBQ sauce. Enjoy!
