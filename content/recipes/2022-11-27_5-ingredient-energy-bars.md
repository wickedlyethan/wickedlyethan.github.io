ingredients:
- 1 cup almonds*, pulsed or roughly chopped
- 1 1/2 cup quick 1-minute oats, uncooked
- 1/2 cup honey (or maple syrup)**
- 1 cup almond butter (or nut butter of choice)
- 2 Tbsp. coconut oil, melted
- 1/2 tsp. salt (optional)
- 1 cup dried cranberries, dried tart cherries, chocolate chips, other dried fruits
  or nuts.
directions:
- Place almonds, oats, and cranberries (or other mix ins you want) in a medium sized
  bowl. Heat the honey, coconut oil and nut butter in a small saucepan over low heat
  until mixed. Pour the peanut butter mixture over the oat and almond mixture and
  stir together.
- Once mixed, transfer to an 8x8-inch baking dish and flatten into a 1-inch thick
  square.
- Cover with plastic wrap and place in the fridge overnight or for 2-3 hours. Then,
  cut and store in an airtight container. Will stay good for up to 5 days in fridge.
  (I also like to store mine in a freezer safe baggie. When I am ready to grab a bar,
  I'll let it sit on the counter for 10 minutes to soften and then enjoy!)
