ingredients:
- 2 large yellow onions, peeled (about 1 pound)
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- Kosher salt
- Low-sodium chicken broth or water (for pan; optional)
directions:
- Halve both onions through root end. Using the tip of your knife, cut a V-shaped
  notch around root to remove it (this will ensure that all slices separate when you
  cut the onion).
- Place 1 onion half on your cutting board so root end is facing you, then thinly
  slice onion lengthwise, starting at one side and working all the way to the other
  (so your knife runs through the root halfway through, not starting or ending at
  the root end). You’re going for slices that are ¼"–⅛" thick.
- Repeat same slicing procedure for remaining onion halves. It’s a lot of onion! But
  it will cook down quite a bit, so it’s best to start with a large quantity.
- Heat 2 Tbsp. butter in a large saucepan over medium until melted and sizzling. You
  can use a skillet to cook the onions, but a pan with high sides will keep the onions
  from flipping out onto your stove. Using a pan that also has a wide base gives water
  room to evaporate, allowing the onions to caramelize rather than steam.
- Instead of dumping in all of the onions at once, which would fill the pot and make
  it hard to stir (which would then cause the ones on the bottom to cook faster),
  start by adding just a couple of large handfuls to the pot. Cook, stirring, until
  onions are soft and starting to turn translucent, 1–2 minutes. Stir in a few more
  handfuls of onion and repeat cooking and stirring process until you’ve added all
  the onions. Season with a pinch of salt.
- Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook onions, stirring every few minutes
  to prevent them from sticking and coloring too much in any one place, until blonde-colored,
  15–20 minutes. This is the point of doneness for French onion soup! If you feel
  like onions are getting too brown around the edges or they’re sticking, reduce your
  heat a bit.
- If you’re going for onions that are both softer and more caramelized (say for a
  patty melt or onion dip), keep cooking, stirring on the regular, until onions are
  unmistakably golden brown, another 15–20 minutes. Because most of the water has
  cooked off at this point, there might be some bare spots where the pot could start
  to burn. If this happens, stir in a splash of broth or water. The liquid will dissolve
  the cooked-on bits, which the onions will re-absorb.
- For extra-dark onions, the kind that make a great burger topping, cook until they
  start to almost blacken around the edges and go slightly crisp, another 10–15 minutes.
  This requires constant attention so they don’t burn. No one said caramelized onions
  were quick!
- 'Let onions cool in the saucepan, then use or transfer to an airtight container
  and chill. They will keep up to 1 week. Editor’s note: This recipe was originally
