ingredients:
  - 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
  - 1 small white onion, thinly sliced
  - 1 large russet potato, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch cubes
  - 1 cup fat-free, reduced-sodium chicken broth
  - 8 8-inch fat-free tortillas
directions:
  - Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Coat 2 nonstick rimmed baking sheets with nonstick spray oil.
  - In a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat, heat the oil. Add the onion and cook, stirring often, for about 6 minutes or until golden brown. Add the potato and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the stock or broth and cook for 8 to 12 minutes, or until the potatoes are soft and the liquid has been absorbed. Add salt and pepper to taste.
  - Arrange 4 of the tortillas on the baking sheets. Divide the potato mixture among the tortillas and spread evenly. Top each with 1 of the remaining tortillas. Lightly coat the tops with nonstick spray oil. Bake for 5 minutes, turn over and bake another 5 minutes, or until lightly browned and heated through. Cut each quesadilla into 8 wedges.
