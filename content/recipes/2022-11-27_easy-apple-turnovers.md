ingredients:
- 2 cups small diced (peeled) apples
- 1 Tablespoon brown sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1 Tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 (17.3-oz.) package frozen puff pastry (2 sheets), thawed
- Flour, for dusting work surface
- 1 large egg, whisked
- Crystal sanding sugar (optional)
directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or Silpats.
- In a large bowl, stir together the apples, brown sugar, cinnamon and lemon juice.
- Unfold the puff pastry sheets onto a lightly floured work surface. Using a rolling
  pin, gently roll over the pastry to seal any perforations then cut each sheet into
  4 squares.
- Using a slotted spoon, scoop a portion of the apple mixture into the center of each
  puff pastry square then fold the pastry across diagonally to form triangles. Using
  a fork, crimp together the edges then transfer the turnovers to the prepared baking
  sheets, spacing them at least 2 inches apart.
- Cut three small slits in the tops of each turnover then brush them with the egg.
  Sprinkle the turnovers with the sanding sugar (optional).
- Bake the turnovers for 17 to 20 minutes or until they’re golden brown and puffed.
  Transfers the turnovers to a rack to cool then serve warm or at room temperature.
