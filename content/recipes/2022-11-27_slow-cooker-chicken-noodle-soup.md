ingredients:
- 1 yellow onion ($0.32)
- 3 cloves garlic ($0.24)
- 1/2 lb. carrots (about 4 medium) ($0.30)
- 4 ribs celery ($0.43)
- 2 split chicken breasts* (2-2.5 lbs. total) ($6.30)
- 1 tsp dried basil ($0.10)
- 1 Tbsp dried parsley ($0.30)
- 1/2 tsp dried thyme ($0.05)
- 1 bay leaf ($0.15)
- 1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper ($0.05)
- 8 cups water ($0.00)
- 6 oz. wide egg noodles ($0.68)
- 1 Tbsp salt (or to taste) ($0.10)
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (optional) ($0.20)
directions:
- Dice the onion, mince the garlic, peel and slice the carrots, and slice the celery.
  Add the onion, garlic, carrots, and celery to a 6 quart slow cooker or crock pot.
- Remove the skin from the bone-in split chicken breasts, then place them on top of
  the vegetables in the slow cooker. Add the basil, parsley, thyme, bay leaf, and
  pepper to the slow cooker.
- Pour 8 cups of water over the ingredients in the slow cooker. Place the lid on the
  slow cooker and cook on high for 4 hours or low for 8 hours.
- After cooking on high for 4 hours or low for 8 hours, carefully remove the chicken
  to a cutting board and discard the bay leaf. Add the egg noodles to the slow cooker,
  stir to combine, and replace the lid, with the heat turned on to high.
- Use two forks to remove the chicken meat from the bones, shredding the meat as you
  go. Return the meat to the slow cooker and stir to combine with the soup. The noodles
  should be tender after about 8-10 minutes of being in the soup (this may take a
  few minutes longer if the slow cooker was previously set to low).
- Once the chicken has been returned to the soup and the noodles are tender, begin
  seasoning the soup with salt. The true flavor of the soup will not be pronounced
  until it is properly salted. Start with 1 tsp salt, adding more until the soup is
  bold and flavorful. I use about 1 Tbsp (3 tsp). Finally, stir in a handful of chopped
  parsley for garnish just before serving.
