ingredients:
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 large eggs
- 0.5 cup milk
- 0.5 cup water
- 0.25 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted
directions:
- Whisk flour and eggs together in a large mixing bowl; gradually add in milk and
  water, stirring to combine. Add salt and melted butter; beat until smooth.
- Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop
  the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crêpe. Tilt the
  pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.
- Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light
  brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen the
  crêpe; flip and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute
  more. Serve hot.
