description: Any type of tomatoes will work, though cherry tomatoes hold their shape
  well. If what you’ve got is a couple of ripe beefsteaks or Romas, cut them into
  1" pieces and carry on.

ingredients:
- ¼ cup olive oil, plus more for drizzling
- 5 garlic cloves, smashed
- Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
- ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- 20 ounces cherry tomatoes
- 1 bunch Swiss chard, preferably rainbow
- 6 large eggs
- 4 thin slices country-style bread
- 1 lemon
- Flaky sea salt or kosher salt
- Handful of basil leaves
directions:
- Heat ¼ cup oil in a medium skillet over medium-high. When it just starts to shimmer,
  add garlic and season generously with kosher salt and black pepper. Cook, stirring
  constantly, until garlic is just turning golden around the edges, about 2 minutes.
  Stir in red pepper flakes, then add tomatoes and cook, tossing occasionally, until
  tomatoes look plumped and some of the skins start to split, about 2 minutes.
- Reduce heat to medium. Cover pan and cook, stirring tomatoes every couple of minutes
  and lightly smashing them with a wooden spoon to encourage them to release some
  juices, until mixture is saucy and tomatoes are slightly deflated but still hold
  some shape, 5–7 minutes.
- Meanwhile, strip leaves off Swiss chard stems and tear into bite-sized pieces (or
  bigger, your call). Reserve stems for your next sauté. Transfer leaves to a medium
  bowl.
- Reduce heat under tomatoes to medium-low (sauce should be bubbling gently). Carefully
  crack eggs into a large measuring glass, then slip one at a time into tomato mixture,
  spacing them evenly apart around perimeter of pan. Season eggs with salt and pepper,
  cover pan, and cook until whites are set but yolks are still runny, 4–6 minutes.
- While eggs are cooking, toast bread until crisp. Drizzle with oil, then firmly rub
  outside of lemon onto toasts to release aromatic oils from peel (you’ll smell it!).
  Sprinkle toasts with sea salt.
- Squeeze about 2 Tbsp. lemon juice over greens, then toss in basil. Drizzle some
  oil over and season with kosher salt and black pepper. Toss again to combine.
- Scoop an egg out of pan, spooning it up from underneath to keep the yolk intact,
  and transfer to a small shallow bowl. Spoon extra sauce around egg and sprinkle
  with sea salt. Repeat with remaining eggs. Serve with salad and toasts alongside.
- 'Do Ahead: Tomato mixture can be made 1 day ahead. Let cool; cover and chill. Reheat
  over medium until simmering before adding eggs.'
