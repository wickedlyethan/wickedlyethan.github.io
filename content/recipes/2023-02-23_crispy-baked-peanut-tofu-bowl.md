ingredients:
- 2 cups cooked rice (quinoa or rice noodles are also great)
- 1 avocado
- 2 red bell peppers
- 3 cups chopped kale
- 4 green onions (chopped)
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 'Optional: chopped peanuts for garnish'
- 1 block extra firm tofu
- 1 tbsp low sodium tamari or soy sauce
- 1 tsp toasted sesame oil
- 1 tsp maple syrup or honey
- 2 tbsp corn starch
- 2 tbsp gluten free plain breadcrumbs (or regular)
- 1/2 cup peanut sauce
directions:
- drain tofu
- Remove the tofu from the package and drain out the excess liquid. If you're using
  extra firm tofu, you shouldn't need to press it, but you are more than welcome to.
- cut tofu
- Chop the tofu into small cubes, about 1/2 to 1 inch.
- marinate
- Add to a bowl with the marinade (1 tbsp tamari, 1 tsp sesame oil, and 1 tbsp maple
  syrup).
- let sit
- Let marinate for about 20 minutes.
- preheat
- Preheat the oven to 375 Fahrenheit.
- toss with corn starch
- Once marinated, toss with the cornstarch, then toss with the breadcrumbs. Add to
  a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving space between each piece so they
  can really get crispy.
- bake
- Bake for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown and crispy.
- make sauce
- While baking, prepare your sauce and veggies. The sauce calls for 1/4 - 1/2 cup
  of water to thin it out for this recipe, you'll want to use closer to 1/2 cup. The
  sauce makes more than you will need for this recipe, but it stores really well in
  the fridge so you can save it for noodles or use as a dip for veggies.
- saute vegetables
- Slice the red peppers into thin strips and add to a pan with 1 tbsp of oil. Saute
  for 10 minutes or until it starts to brown on the sides. Add in the kale and let
  wilt for 1-2 minutes.
- let tofu cool
- When the tofu is done, remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes. Toss with
  1/2 cup of sauce.
- serve
- Assemble your bowls starting with the rice, add the veggies, avocado, scallions
  and tofu and drizzle with the remaining sauce.
