ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon light oil ((such as canola or vegetable))
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce ((gluten-free if preferred))
- 2 teaspoons chili powder
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne ((optional for spice))
- 1 block (350g) extra-firm tofu, (drained (no need to press it))
- 3/4 - 1 1/4 cups salsa
directions:
- Preheat your oven to 350F (180C). Line with parchment paper or lightly grease a
  large baking sheet.
- Mix the oil, soy sauce, and all the spices in a large bowl. It will make a brown
  paste-like texture.
- Crumble the block of tofu with your fingers into the bowl with the seasoning. Mix
  the tofu crumbles with the seasoning making sure all of the tofu is evenly coated.
  Spread the tofu crumbles evenly over the pan. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, stopping
  to stir the tofu every now and then. Keep a close eye on it towards the end so that
  it doesn't burn. You want the tofu to be nice and browned. The smaller crumbles
  will be darker than the larger crumbles, and that's ok because it will provide a
  variety of texture.
- Remove the tofu crumbles from the oven and add to a pan with the 3/4 cup salsa.
  You may need more salsa depending on how watery the salsa is and how wet you would
  like your tofu crumbles to be, add more salsa to taste. Heat through and serve hot
  on taco shells with desired toppings or in a burrito.
