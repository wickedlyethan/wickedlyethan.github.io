description: Everybody has heard of molten chocolate cake, so we thought we’d try
  to create a caramel version, with a toffee-ish tender cake encasing a runny dulce
  de leche center. Well, folks, it worked.

ingredients:
- ¼ cup store-bought dulce de leche
- 1 Tbsp. unsalted butter, room temperature
- ⅔ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp. kosher salt
- ¼ tsp. baking powder
- 6 Tbsp. unsalted butter, plus more for ramekins, room temperature
- ⅓ cup sugar, plus more for ramekins
- ¼ cup store-bought dulce de leche
- 2 large eggs, room temperature
- ½ tsp. vanilla extract
- Four 6–8-oz. ramekins
directions:
- Stir dulce de leche and butter in a small bowl until well combined. Dollop in 4
  equal-size blobs on a metal baking dish or baking sheet. Freeze at least 30 minutes
  or up to overnight until very firm (the sugar will keep it from freezing completely
  solid).
- Preheat oven to 350°. Whisk flour, salt, and baking powder in a small bowl; set
  aside.
- Coat ramekins with butter in a thin, even layer, then coat with sugar, knocking
  out any excess.
- Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed (use the paddle attachment if you’re
  using a stand mixer), beat ⅓ cup sugar and 6 Tbsp. butter in a medium bowl until
  light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add dulce de leche and continue to beat until
  incorporated, about 1 minute. Beat in eggs, one at a time, until combined, followed
  by vanilla. Beat mixture on medium-high speed 1 minute (it might look slightly grainy
  and separated, and that’s okay!). Reduce mixer speed to low and beat in reserved
  dry ingredients until smooth.
- Divide batter among prepared ramekins. Make a small divot with a spoon in the top
  of each mound of batter. Place frozen filling onto divots, but do not press down
  into batter; you want the filling cradled by the batter but still on the surface,
  as it will sink to the center during baking. Place ramekins on a small rimmed baking
  sheet. Bake cakes until tops are browned, firm to the touch (be careful when checking
  as the filling may ooze out and it is very hot), and a tester inserted into the
  cakes, avoiding the liquid centers, comes out clean, 23–25 minutes.
- Invert cakes onto plates to serve. (If you invert the first cake and see slightly
  underdone batter—it will be tan against the filling’s dark brown color—keep remaining
  cakes in ramekins a couple minutes longer before unmolding. You can still eat the
  underdone one!)
