ingredients:
- 2 tsp adobo seasoning ($0.20)
- 1.5 lbs boneless chicken thighs ($6.49)
- 2 2/3 Tbsp cooking oil, divided ($0.11)
- 1/4 cup sofrito ($0.36)
- 1 red bell pepper, small dice, divided ($0.98)
- 1/2 yellow onion, small dice ($0.19)
- 3 cloves garlic, minced ($0.24)
- 2 Tbsp tomato sauce ($0.06)
- 1/2 cup pimiento stuffed Spanish olives ($1.16)
- 2 cups rice ($0.74)
- 2 1/2 cups chicken stock ($1.12)
- 1/4 tsp salt ($0.02)
- 1 1/2 tsp sazón seasoning ($0.19)
- 1/2 cup frozen green peas ($0.33)
- 1/4 cup cilantro (optional garnish) ($0.11)
directions:
- Place chicken thighs in a shallow bowl and rub down with 2 teaspoons of cooking
  oil and adobo seasoning. Place uncovered in your refrigerator and allow to marinate
  for thirty minutes.
- Set a Dutch oven or other heavy-bottomed large pot over medium-high heat. Add the
  remaining 2 tablespoons of cooking oil to the pot. Once the oil is shimmering, add
  the chicken thighs to the pot, arranged in an even layer. Sear each side of the
  thighs until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Remove the thighs from the
  pot and set them aside.
- Add the sofrito, diced onion, and half of the diced red pepper to the chicken fat
  in the pot. Sauté until the onion is translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic,
  tomato sauce, and olives. Sauté the mixture until it's fragrant and most of the
  liquid has cooked out. A spoon run down the middle of the pan should leave a dry
  trail.
- Add the rice, sazón, and salt and gently mix them into all of the ingredients, so
  that every grain is covered in the sauce. Add chicken stock and bring to a boil.
  Allow mixture to boil undisturbed until some of the stock has evaporated and the
  rice is visible on the surface of the pot, about 5 to 8 minutes. There should be
  multiple round steam vents on the surface of the rice.
- Place the reserved chicken thighs on top of the rice. Lower the heat to low and
  cover the pot with a tight-fitting heavy lid. Cook for 20 minutes, until all of
  the stock has evaporated and rice has cooked through.
- Remove the chicken from the pot and set it aside. Stir in frozen peas and fluff
  the rice. Add the chicken thighs back to the pot. Garnish with the remainder of
  the diced red pepper and cilantro leaves.
