ingredients:
- 1 fresh lemon ($0.79)
- 1/4 bunch Italian parsley ($0.25)
- 3 cloves garlic ($0.24)
- 2-3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 2 lbs) ($4.99)
- Pinch salt and pepper ($0.05)
- 1/2 cup flour ($0.03)
- 2 Tbsp olive oil ($0.26)
- 2 Tbsp butter ($0.27)
- 1/2 cup chicken broth* ($0.07)
- 1 Tbsp capers ($0.40)
directions:
- Prepare the lemon, parsley, and garlic so they’re ready to go when you need them.
  Roughly chop the parsley leaves, juice the lemon, and mince the garlic. Set these
  ingredients aside.
- Trim the chicken breasts of excess fat. Cover them with plastic wrap and pound them
  with a mallet or rolling pin until they are an even thickness (about 1/2-3/4 inch
  thick). Cut each chicken breast in half so that you have four to six pieces about
  the size of the palm of your hand. Season both sides of the chicken pieces with
  salt and pepper.
- Heat the olive oil in a heavy skillet, over medium heat. While the oil is heating,
  place the flour in a bowl and lightly coat each piece of chicken on both sides.
  When the oil is very hot but not smoking, add the chicken pieces to the skillet
  and cook until golden brown on each side (about 3-5 minutes on each side). Cook
  the chicken in batches, if needed, to prevent them from overcrowding the skillet.
  Transfer the browned chicken on a clean plate.
- After removing the chicken from the skillet, turn the heat down to medium-low and
  add the butter and minced garlic. Sauté the garlic in the butter for about one minute.
  Add the chicken broth and lemon juice to the skillet and whisk to dissolve (or “deglaze”)
  the brown bits off of the bottom of the pan.
- Add the capers and half of the chopped parsley to the skillet. Increase the heat
  to medium, add the chicken back to the skillet, and spoon the sauce over top. Allow
  the chicken to simmer in the sauce for 3-5 minutes, without a lid, or until the
  sauce reduces by half. The flour on the chicken will help thicken the sauce as it
  simmers. Sprinkle the remaining parsley over top just before serving.
