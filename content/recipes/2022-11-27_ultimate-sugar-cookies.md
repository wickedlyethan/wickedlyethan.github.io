ingredients:
- ¾ tsp. kosher salt
- ½ tsp. baking powder
- 3 cups (375 g) all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling
- 1¼ cups (2½ sticks) chilled unsalted butter, cut into ½-inch pieces
- 1 cup (200 g) sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 large egg yolk
- 1 tsp. vanilla extract
- Colored sanding sugar or Easy Sugar Cookie Icing, for decorating
directions:
- Whisk salt, baking powder, and 3 cups flour in a small bowl. Using an electric mixer
  on high speed, beat butter and sugar until well combined (butter does not need to
  be fluffy), about 3 minutes. Add egg, egg yolk, and vanilla; beat just to combine.
  Reduce speed to low and gradually add dry ingredients; mix just to combine. Form
  dough into two ¾"-thick disks; wrap in plastic. Chill at least 2 hours.
- Place racks in lower and upper thirds of oven; preheat to 325°. Let 1 disk of dough
  sit at room temperature until softened slightly, about 5 minutes. Roll out on a
  lightly floured sheet of parchment paper until about ¼" thick, dusting with flour
  as needed (if dough gets soft or sticky, chill on parchment until firm). Cut out
  shapes with floured cookie cutters; transfer to parchment-lined baking sheets.
- Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets halfway through, until edges are golden, 12–16
  minutes, depending on size. Transfer to wire racks and let cool. Repeat with scraps
  and remaining dough.
- 'Decorate cooled cookies as desired. Do ahead: Cookie dough can be made 1 month
  ahead; freeze instead of chilling. Cookies can be baked (left undecorated) 2 weeks
  ahead; wrap tightly and freeze. Editor’s note: This recipe was originally printed
  in our December 2013 issue. This way to more of our best Christmas cookie recipes
