ingredients:
- 1.5 lbs. boneless, skinless chicken thighs* ($4.50)
- 1 tsp smoked paprika ($0.10)
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder ($0.02)
- 1/4 tsp salt ($0.02)
- 1 Tbsp cooking oil ($0.04)
- 1/2 cup chicken broth ($0.07)
- 2 Tbsp stone ground or whole grain mustard ($0.16)
- 2 Tbsp honey ($0.24)
- 1 Tbsp butter ($0.13)
directions:
- Heat a large skillet over medium flame. While the skillet is preheating, combine
  the smoked paprika, garlic powder, and salt in a small dish. Sprinkle the spice
  mixture over both sides of your chicken pieces.
- Once the skillet is nice and hot, add the cooking oil and swirl to coat the surface.
  Add the chicken pieces and cook on each side until well browned and cooked through
  (about 5 minutes each side, this can vary with your cookware and size of your chicken
  pieces). Transfer the cooked chicken to a clean plate.
- Add the chicken broth to the skillet and stir to dissolve the browned bits from
  the bottom of the skillet. Allow the broth to simmer in the skillet for about 5
  minutes, or until it has reduced by half.
- Finally, add the mustard, honey, and butter to the skillet. Stir to melt and dissolve
  the ingredients together. Add the chicken and juices back to the skillet, and allow
  the sauce to come back up to a simmer. Spoon the honey mustard sauce over top, then
  serve.
