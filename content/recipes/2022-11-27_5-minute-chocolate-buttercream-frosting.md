ingredients:
- 6 Tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- 2 1/3 cups confectioners’ sugar
- 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/3 cup whole milk
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
directions:
- In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter
  on medium speed until it is smooth, about 1 minute.
- Add the confectioners’ sugar and cocoa powder to the bowl and beat until combined.
  With the stand mixer running on low speed, slowly stream in the milk and vanilla
  extract then add the salt and continue beating until well combined, scraping down
  the sides as needed, about 2 minutes.
- Increase the speed to high and beat the frosting for an additional 2 minutes. Use
  the frosting immediately or store in an airtight container in the fridge. (If you
  refrigerate the frosting, you may want to re-blend it for a few seconds in the stand
  mixer before using it.)
