ingredients:
- 2 Tbsp olive oil ($0.32)
- 4 cloves garlic, minced ($0.32)
- 1/2 tsp cumin ($0.05)
- 1/2 tsp salt ($0.02)
- freshly cracked pepper ($0.05)
- 2 limes, divided ($0.40)
- 1/2 bunch cilantro, divided ($0.40)
- 6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs (1.5 to 1.75 lbs. total) ($5.11)
directions:
- Combine the olive oil, minced garlic, cumin, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper
  (about 10 cranks of a pepper mill) in a small bowl.
- Zest one of the limes and then squeeze the juice. You'll need 2-3 Tbsp juice, so
  if needed, juice half of the second lime. Cut the remaining lime into wedges to
  garnish the chicken once cooked. Roughly chop the cilantro.
- Add 1 tsp of the lime zest, 2-3 Tbsp of the lime juice, and half of the chopped
  cilantro to the marinade. Stir to combine. (The remaining cilantro will be added
  fresh after cooking the chicken.)
- Place the chicken thighs in a shallow dish or a large zip top bag. Add the marinade
  and toss the chicken to coat. Allow the chicken to marinate for 30 minutes or up
  to 8 hours (refrigerated), turning it once or twice as it marinates.
- When ready to cook the chicken, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once
  hot, add the chicken and cook for 5-7 minutes on each side, or until well browned
  and cooked through. My chicken had enough of an oil coating from the marinade that
  I did not need to add any extra to the skillet.
- Top the cooked chicken with more fresh cilantro and a squeeze of fresh lime juice.
  Serve with any extra lime wedges.
