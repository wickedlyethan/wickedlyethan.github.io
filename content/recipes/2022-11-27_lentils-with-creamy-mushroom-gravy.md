ingredients:
- 2 cloves garlic ($0.16)
- 8 oz. mushrooms ($1.69)
- 2 Tbsp olive oil ($0.32)
- 1 cup brown lentils ($0.50)
- 1/2 tsp dried thyme ($0.05)
- 3/4 tsp rubbed (dried) sage ($0.07)
- Freshly cracked black pepper ($0.03)
- 2 cups vegetable broth ($0.26)
- 1 13.5oz. can coconut milk ($1.99)
- salt to taste (about 1/2 tsp) ($0.02)
directions:
- Mince the garlic and slice the mushrooms. Add the olive oil and garlic to a large
  skillet and sauté for about one minute. Add the sliced mushrooms and continue to
  sauté until the mushrooms have released all their moisture and begin to brown.
- Add the lentils, sage, thyme, freshly cracked pepper, and vegetable broth to the
  skillet with the mushrooms. Stir to combine. Place a lid on the skillet, let the
  broth come up to a boil, then turn the heat down to medium-low. Let the lentils
  simmer for 20 minutes (with lid), stirring occasionally.
- After simmering for 20 minutes, the lentils should be tender and most of the broth
  absorbed. Add the coconut milk, stir to combine, turn the heat back up to medium,
  and let the lentils simmer for about five more minutes (without lid), or until the
  mixture in the skillet has thickened to a gravy.
- Once the mixture has thickened, turn the heat off. Taste the mixture and add salt
  to your liking. I added about 1/2 tsp. The salt will help the herbal flavors pop
  and reduce the sweetness of the coconut milk.
- Serve hot with crusty bread for dipping or over mashed potatoes, rice, or pasta.
