description: Short of a box mix, this cream biscuit is the simplest biscuit out there.
servings: 12 biscuits
prep_time: 15 Minutes
cook_time: 15 Minutes
total_time: 30 Minutes
categories: Bread
tags: 
ingredients:
  - 2 cups (11 ounces) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting,
  - 1 1/2 tablespoons (.6 ounce) baking powder,
  - 1 teaspoon (.2 ounce) kosher salt,
  - 1 tablespoon (.5 ounce) granulated sugar,
  - 1 1/2 cups heavy cream
directions:
  -  In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.
  -  Add heavy cream and stir gently with a wooden spoon until dry ingredients are just moistened. 
  -  Turn out dough onto a lighted floured work surface. Using your hands, fold it one or two times so it becomes a cohesive mass and press it down to an even 1⁄2-inch thickness. Using a 2-inch round cookie-cutter, cut out biscuits as closely together as possible. Gather together scraps, pat down, and cut out more biscuits. Discard any remaining scraps. 
  -  Bake the biscuits in a 400°F oven until risen and golden, about 12-15 minutes. Let cool slightly and serve warm.
