ingredients:
- 1 Tbsp smoked paprika ($0.30)
- 1 tsp thyme ($0.10)
- 1 tsp oregano ($0.10)
- 1/2 tsp cumin ($0.05)
- 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper ($0.03)
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder ($0.03)
- 1/4 tsp onion powder ($0.03)
- 1/4 tsp salt ($0.02)
- Freshly cracked pepper ($0.05)
- 1/2 lb peeled and deveigned shrimp ($4.31)
- 2 Tbsp butter ($0.25)
- 2 cloves garlic ($0.16)
- 15 oz can petite diced tomatoes ($1.09)
- 1/4 tsp salt ($0.02)
- 1/2 lb pasta ($0.50)
- 2-3 green onions, sliced ($0.17)
- Handful fresh parsley ($0.20)
- 1 lemon ($0.69)
directions:
- In a small bowl, combine the herbs and spices for the blackening seasoning. Rinse
  the shrimp under cool water, drain, and then pat dry with a paper towel. Sprinkle
  the blackening seasoning over the shrimp and stir to coat.
- Bring a large pot of water to a boil for the pasta. Once boiling, add the pasta
  and cook until tender (7-10 minutes). Reserve about 1 cup of the starchy pasta water,
  then drain the pasta in a colander.
- While the pasta is cooking, mince the garlic and add it to a large skillet with
  the butter. Heat the butter and garlic over a medium flame until the butter starts
  to foam and sizzle. Continue to sauté the garlic in the sizzling butter for about
  one minute. Add the shrimp and sauté until they are opaque and slightly firm (3-5
  minutes), then remove them from the skillet.
- Add the diced tomatoes (with juices) and about 1/2 cup of the pasta water to the
  skillet. Stir and cook over medium heat, dissolving the browned bits from the bottom
  of the skillet. Let the sauce simmer for 5-10 minutes, or until thickened slightly.
  Taste the sauce and add salt if needed (I added 1/4 tsp salt).
- Add the cooked and drained pasta to the skillet and toss with the sauce (add some
  of the remaining reserved pasta water, if needed, to loosen the pasta). Return the
  shrimp to the skillet and stir to combine.
- Slice the green onions and chop the parsley leaves. Sprinkle both over top. Serve
  with sliced lemon to squeeze over top.
