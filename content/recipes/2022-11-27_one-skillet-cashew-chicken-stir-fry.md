ingredients:
- 1 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 lb boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 2 cups broccoli florets
- 1 red bell pepper, julienned
- 1 cup sugar snap peas
- 1/2 cup carrots, julienned
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/3 cup unsalted cashews
- 4 green onions, chopped
- 4 Tbsp lower sodium tamari (or soy sauce)
- 3 Tbsp all-natural peanut butter
- 2 Tbsp honey
- 1 tsp. sesame oil
- 1 Tbsp grated ginger
- 2 or 3 Tbsp water (or chicken/vegetable broth)
directions:
- In a large skillet over medium heat, drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil to coat the
  pan. Once the pan is hot, add the chicken in an even layer. Season with salt and
  pepper and cook until lightly browned, about 4 to 5 minutes, stirring the chicken
  as needed. Once the chicken is cooked, transfer to a plate and set aside.
- Drizzle another tablespoon of olive oil onto the hot skillet and add the broccoli,
  bell pepper, snap peas and carrots. Cook the vegetables until tender, about 4 to
  5 minutes, stirring frequently.
- To make the peanut sauce, whisk together tamari (or soy sauce), peanut butter, honey,
  sesame oil, and grated ginger in a small bowl. Whisk in 2 or 3 tablespoons of water
  (or broth), depending on the consistency you prefer, and set aside.
- Once the veggies are nice and tender, add the chicken back to the pan and mix together.
  Add in the garlic and cook for about a minute, then add in cashews and pour the
  peanut sauce over top. Mix well, making sure everything is coated, and bring the
  sauce to a boil. Turn down the heat and simmer until sauce has thickened up and
  everything is incorporated.
- Sprinkle with green onions, serve and enjoy!
