ingredients:
- ½ cup sun dried tomatoes ($1.66)
- 2 Tbsp butter ($0.26)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced ($0.16)
- 8 oz. fettuccine ($0.67)
- 1/2 tsp dried basil ($0.05)
- Freshly cracked pepper ($0.05)
- 2 cups chicken broth* ($0.26)
- 2 oz. cream cheese ($0.30)
- 1 cups whole milk ($0.37)
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan ($0.44)
directions:
- Chop the sun dried tomatoes into small bite-sized pieces.
- Add the butter and garlic to a deep skillet or Dutch oven. Sauté the garlic over
  medium heat for about one minute, or until it is very fragrant.
- Add the fettuccine, sun dried tomatoes, dried basil, some freshly cracked pepper,
  and the chicken broth to the skillet. If needed, break the fettuccine in half to
  make sure it lays flat in the skillet and is submerged in broth.
- Place a lid on the skillet, turn the heat up to high, and bring the broth to a boil.
  As soon as it reaches a boil, give the pasta a good stir, replace the lid, and turn
  the heat down to low or the lowest setting that maintains a simmer.
- Let the pasta simmer in the broth for 7-10 minutes, or until most of the broth is
  absorbed and the pasta is tender, stirring every couple of minutes and always replacing
  the lid.
- Keeping the heat on low, cut the cream cheese into chunks and stir it into the pasta.
  Once the cream cheese has melted, add the milk and stir until a smooth sauce forms.
  Finally, add the grated Parmesan over top and stir until it has melted into the
  sauce. Serve with extra freshly cracked pepper, if desired.
