ingredients:
- 2 chicken breasts (cut in half lengthwise)
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- Salt & pepper (to taste)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1/2 medium onion (chopped)
- 3/4 cup chicken broth ((use low sodium if sensitive to salt))
- 1 (5.2 oz/150g) package Boursin Fine Herbs & Garlic cheese (softened)
- 1-2 tablespoons chopped parsley (to taste, optional)
directions:
- Cut the chicken breasts in half lengthwise to get 4 thinner pieces. Season them
  with the garlic powder and some salt & pepper.
- Add the oil and butter to a skillet over medium-high heat and let it heat up for
  a few minutes. Cook the chicken for about 5-6 minutes/side or until cooked through,
  then transfer it to a plate.
- To the skillet, add the onions and saut√© for about 5 minutes or until softened and
  lightly browned. If the pan seems dry, add a small splash more olive oil.
- Add the chicken broth and the Boursin cheese to the skillet. Stir until you've got
  a smooth sauce. Let it bubble for 5 minutes, then stir in the chopped parsley if
  using.
- Add the chicken (and any plate juices) back into the skillet and let it warm through
  for a couple of minutes. The sauce should be thicker by now (you can always cook
  it a bit longer if need be). If it's too thick, you can add another splash of chicken
  broth.
- Season with salt & pepper if needed (I find the sauce fairly salty when using regular
  broth) and serve immediately.
