ingredients:
- 1 fresh lemon ($0.30)
- 1.25 cups all-purpose flour ($0.13)
- 1/2 tsp salt ($0.02)
- 3/4 cup powdered sugar, divided ($0.15)
- 2 tsp baking powder ($0.08)
- 2 tsp poppy seeds ($0.20)
- 1 cup heavy whipping cream ($1.83)
directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400ÂºF. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Use a small-holed
  cheese grater or a zester to remove the zest from the lemon, then squeeze the juice
  into a separate bowl. You'll need about 1 tsp of zest and 1 Tbsp juice.
- In a large bowl, stir together the flour, salt, 1/4 cup powdered sugar, baking powder,
  poppy seeds, and 1 tsp lemon zest. Make sure these ingredients are well combined.
- Stir the cream into the dry ingredients until a shaggy ball of dough forms. The
  dough will be fairly sticky. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, divide it
  into three pieces, and shape each piece into a disc (about 3 inches diameter). Cut
  each disc into six triangles.
- Arrange the cut scones on the prepared baking sheet. Bake the scones for about 15
  minutes, or until they just begin to barely turn golden brown on top.
- While the scones are baking, place the remaining 1/2 cup powdered sugar in a bowl.
  Stir in about 1 Tbsp lemon juice, or just enough to form a thick glaze.
- When the scones have baked, remove them from the oven, let them cool, then drizzle
  with the prepared lemon glaze.
