description: Dark, bittersweet hot chocolate--made with water, not milk--is enjoyed
  in Mexico City as an alternative to coffee. It's prepared with a special Mexican
  chocolate that usually contains cinnamon, ground almonds and vanilla. Look for high-quality
  brands, such as Taza, Hernán, Rancho Gordo or Seasons of My Heart, which are sold
  in hockey puck-size disks. To create the classic foam, you can use a blender, a
  whisk or a wooden instrument called a molinillo and a tall, heatproof pitcher, such
  as a chocolatera. Both are available online.

directions:
- Bring water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add chocolate, reduce heat to medium

  until foamy.

  foam, if desired.
