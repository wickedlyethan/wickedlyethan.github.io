ingredients:
- 9 oz. ravioli* ($2.89)
- 1 clove garlic, minced ($0.08)
- 1/4 cup walnuts, chopped ($0.57)
- 4 Tbsp butter ($0.52)
- 1/2 tsp dried sage ($0.05)
- 1/4 lb. fresh spinach ($0.60)
- salt and pepper to taste ($0.05)
- 1 Tbsp grated Parmesan ($0.11)
directions:
- Bring a pot of water to a boil for the ravioli. Once boiling, add the ravioli and
  cook until tender (check package for specific cooking times, as this can vary with
  the ravioli size or whether it is fresh or dried). Once cooked, reserve 1/4 cup
  of the cooking water, then drain the ravioli in a colander.
- While the ravioli is cooking, prepare the rest of the dish. Mince the garlic and
  chop the walnuts before you begin the sage brown butter sauce, since the sauce cooks
  very quickly.
- Add the butter to a large skillet and melt it over medium-low heat, stirring continuously.
  Once the butter begins to sizzle and becomes foamy (about 2-3 minutes), add the
  minced garlic and chopped walnuts. Continue to stir and cook over medium-low heat
  until the sediment in the skillet turns deep golden brown (about 3-5 minutes). Once
  it becomes browned, remove it from the heat, and stir in the dried sage.
- Add the spinach and the 1/4 cup reserved ravioli cooking water to the skillet. Return
  the skillet to low heat, and stir until the spinach is wilted (about 2 minutes).
  Taste the spinach and add salt to taste. Finally, add the cooked and drained ravioli
  to the skillet with the spinach and sage brown butter sauce, then toss to coat.
- Serve the ravioli with a light dusting of grated Parmesan and freshly cracked pepper
  over top.
