ingredients:
- 3 cups all-purpose flour ($0.29)
- 1/4 tsp instant or bread machine yeast ($0.02)
- 1/2 Tbsp salt ($0.02)
- 1.5 to 1.75 cup water* ($0.00)
directions:
- The day before baking, combine the flour, yeast, and salt in a large bowl and stir
  until they're well combined. Stir in about 1.5 to 1.75 cups room temperature water
  until a shaggy, sticky ball of dough forms and there is no dry flour left on the
  bottom of the bowl. Cover the bowl loosely with plastic and let it sit at room temperature
  for 12-18 hours.
- When you're ready to bake, sprinkle a little flour on top of the fermented dough,
  and scrape it out of the bowl (the dough should be very light, fluffy, and bubbly
  by this time). With well floured hands, shape the dough into a ball and place it
  on a piece of parchment paper. Let the dough rise for 30-60 minutes.
- While the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 425ÂºF, or the highest recommended
  temperature listed on the packaging for your parchment paper. Place the Dutch oven
  inside the oven as it heats, and make sure it sits in the fully heated oven for
  at least 15 minutes before baking the bread.
- Once the bread has risen and the Dutch oven is fully heated, carefully remove the
  Dutch oven from the oven (it will be EXTREMELY hot). Lift the parchment with the
  dough straight into the dutch oven and cover it with the lid.
- Return the Dutch oven to the oven and bake for 30 minutes. Carefully remove the
  lid and bake for another 15-20 minutes, or until the crust is a deep golden brown.
  Remove the Dutch oven from the oven, lift the bread out by by using the parchment
  paper, and allow it to cool before cutting open and serving.
