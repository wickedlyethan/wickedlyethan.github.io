ingredients:
- 12 ounces tomato paste
- 1/2 cup light brown sugar, or light corn syrup
- 1/2 to 3/4 cup water
- 1/4 cup white wine, or apple cider vinegar
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon ground mustard
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, or medium-grain sea salt
- 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
- 1 pinch ground cloves, optional
- 1 small pinch cayenne pepper, optional
directions:
- Gather the ingredients.
- Combine all of the ingredients—tomato paste, brown sugar, water, white wine, onion
  powder, garlic powder, ground mustard, salt, ground cinnamon, ground allspice, and
  if using, ground cloves and cayenne pepper—in a small pot, using just 1/2 cup of
  the water to start.
- Bring the ingredients to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently.
- Once the mixture reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low and simmer the ketchup for
  15 minutes. Stir every few minutes, scraping the mixture away from the sides of
  the pot and making sure that it isn't sticking to the bottom. Do not let it burn.
  Add more water if necessary to keep it from thickening too much.
- If after 15 minutes you find that you added a little too much water and the ketchup
  is too thin, raise the heat to medium-high and cook for a few minutes, stirring
  constantly, to boil off the excess liquid. The ketchup should be thick enough that
  when you drag a wooden spoon across the bottom of the pot, it leaves an empty trail
  that does not fill in right away.
- Turn off the heat and let the ketchup cool for 5 minutes. Transfer it to clean glass
  jars (it is not necessary to sterilize the jars for this recipe).
- Cover and store in the refrigerator for up to a month, or follow the canning instructions
  below.
