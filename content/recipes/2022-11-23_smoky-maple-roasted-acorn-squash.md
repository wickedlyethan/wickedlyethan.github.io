ingredients:
- 1.5 lb. acorn squash ($1.13)
- 1 Tbsp olive oil ($0.16)
- 1 Tbsp maple syrup ($0.30)
- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika ($0.05)
- 1/4 tsp salt ($0.02)
directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400ÂºF. Wash the squash well, then dry with a clean towel. Carefully
  cut the acorn squash in half lengthwise (from top to bottom), then scrape out the
  seeds with a spoon. Slice the squash crosswise into 1/2-inch wide slices.
- In a small bowl, stir together the olive oil, maple syrup, smoked paprika, and salt.
  Place the sliced squash in a bowl, then pour the maple syrup glaze over top. Stir
  the squash until it is evenly coated.
- Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, then arrange the seasoned squash slices
  on the sheet in a single layer. Use a rubber spatula to scrape all the remaining
  glaze out of the bowl and onto the squash slices.
- Roast the squash slices for 40 minutes, or until it is very tender. Season with
  a pinch of salt, then serve.
