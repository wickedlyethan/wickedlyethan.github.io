ingredients:
- Canola oil
- 4 bratwurst sausages
- 1 red onion, sliced
- 1/2 cup water, beer or stock
- Kosher salt
directions:
- Heat a large cast-iron skillet with a drizzle of canola oil over medium-high heat
  until it just starts to smoke.
- With a fork, poke a few holes on each side of the bratwurst sausages to keep them
  from bursting while they cook.
- Place the brats in the hot skillet, then place the onions around them.
- Stir the onions to spread them around and coat with oil.
- Cook the brats for about 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until they are nicely browned.
- Carefully pour 1/2 cup of water into the skillet, then immediately cover and reduce
  the heat to medium-low.
- Continue to cook with the lid on for about 10 more minutes, or until the internal
  temperature reaches 160° F / 71° C
- Remove the lid and the brats from the skillet.
- Increase the heat and season the onions with salt. Continue to cook the onions for
  a few more minutes to reduce the liquid.
- Serve the sausages topped with the onions and your favorite mustard.
