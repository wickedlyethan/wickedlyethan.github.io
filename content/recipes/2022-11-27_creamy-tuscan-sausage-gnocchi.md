ingredients:
- 8.8 ounces Italian sausages (crumbled)
- 3 cloves garlic (minced)
- 1/2 cup chicken broth
- 1 cup heavy/whipping cream
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- 1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes
- 1 pound potato gnocchi
- 1.5 cups (packed) fresh baby spinach
- 1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese
- Fresh basil (optional) (to taste)
- Salt & pepper (to taste)
directions:
- Take the sausage meat out of the casings and crumble it into a deep skillet. Saut√©
  the sausage over medium-high heat, breaking it up as you go along, until browned
  (about 5-7 minutes).
- Stir in the garlic and cook for about 30 seconds.
- Add the chicken broth, cream, lemon juice, sun-dried tomatoes, and gnocchi to the
  pan. Give it a good stir.
- Reduce the heat to medium and cover the pan. Cook for 5 minutes.
- Give the gnocchi a stir and then add in the spinach. Cover the pan again for 1-2
  minutes until the spinach has wilted.
- Stir in the parmesan and basil (if using). Ensure the gnocchi is cooked through
  and the sauce is thickened to your liking (cook for another minute or two if necessary).
  Season with salt & pepper to taste and serve immediately.
