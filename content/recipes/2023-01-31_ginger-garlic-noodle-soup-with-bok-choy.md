ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 3 shallots (diced)
- 1 bunch green onions (chopped, green and white divided)
- 4 cloves garlic (minced)
- 2 tablespoon ginger (fresh, minced)
- 5.5 cups low sodium chicken broth (or vegetable broth for vegan)
- 2 whole star anise
- 2 tablespoon soy sauce (or Tamari for a Gluten Free option)
- 10 oz crimini mushrooms (sliced)
- 6 oz rice noodles
- 1.5 heads bok choy (roughly chopped)
- sesame seeds (for topping)
- red pepper flakes (for topping)
directions:
- Heat 1-2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium-sized stockpot over medium heat.
- To the oil add the diced shallots and mix well. Cook over medium heat for 4-5 minutes,
  or until the shallots turn translucent and start to soften. Stir often.
- Chop the end off of each green onion- dividing the white part from the green part.
  Chop and set aside the green part for topping. Meanwhile, finely chop the white
  part of each green onion.
- Add the white part of the green onions, minced garlic, and ginger to the shallots
  and mix. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 1-2 minutes or until garlic and ginger
  is fragrant.
- Carefully pour the chicken stock or water (or mix) into the pot and bring to a simmer.
  To the pot add the star anise and soy sauce. Cover and continue to simmer for 10
  minutes.
- Remove lid from the pot and carefully remove and discard each star anise from the
  soup.
- Add the sliced mushrooms, uncooked noodles, and bok choy to the pot and simmer for
  5-8 minutes, or until noodles and bok choy are tender. Season to taste.
- Divide soup between bowls and garnish with sesame seeds, the green parts of green
  onions and red pepper flakes (if desired).
