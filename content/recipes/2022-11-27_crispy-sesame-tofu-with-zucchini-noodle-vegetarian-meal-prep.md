ingredients:
- 1/2 cup Peanut butter
- 2 tablespoons Sesame Oil
- 1/4 cup Light low sodium Soy Sauce
- 1/4 cup Rice Vinegar
- 1 teaspoon Chilli Flakes
- 2 tablespoons Maple Syrup (or Honey)
- 2-3 Garlic Cloves (roughly chopped)
- 1 knob Ginger (peeled and roughly chopped)
- 1 tablespoon Oil
- 350 gms Firm Tofu (cut into small pieces)
- Zucchinis (spiralized)
- Sesame Seeds and Green Onions ( for topping)
directions:
- Make the Sauce
- In a blender or add all the ingredients for the sauce along with a splash of water
  and blend till smooth. Set aside 1/4 cup sauce and divide the rest in the mini sauce
  containers. You might be left with a little extra sauce which you can reserve for
  later - it works really well as a salad dressing!
- Cook the crispy tofu
- Heat oil in a pan and add the tofu. As soon as the tofu is a very light brown, add
  1/4 cup sauce to the pan and toss the tofu in it. Cook everything on low heat. In
  some time, the sauce will start to evaporate and slowly it will start turning into
  golden brown and sticking to the pan and tofu. Things will become crispy and you
  finally you'll be left with crispy browned bits of tofu in the pan.
- Assemble
- To assemble the meal prep containers, divide zucchini noodles in the containers.
  Divide the tofu amongst the containers and place the mini sauce containers on one
  side. Place the lid and refrigerate for up to 5 days.
