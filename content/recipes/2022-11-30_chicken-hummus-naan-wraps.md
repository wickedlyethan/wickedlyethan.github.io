ingredients:
- 4 pieces of naan bread (for a gluten-free version use this recipe with GF AP flour
  or this recipe with cassava flour)
- 1 cup of roasted red pepper hummus
- 4 cups of organic spring mix
- 3 cups of shredded cooked chicken (like leftover slow cooker lemon pepper chicken
  OR rotisserie chicken)
- 2 cups of the veggie mixture with dressing (see below for recipe)
- 4 tablespoons of full-fat feta cheese or goat cheese
- 'For garnish (added to each wrap):'
- 1 1/2 teaspoons of extra vinaigrette or juice from the veggies
- Sea salt & black pepper, to taste
- Drizzle of good-quality extra virgin olive oil
- 1/2 cup of peeled, sliced & quartered cucumber
- 1 cup of quartered cherry tomatoes
- 1/2 cup of peeled & diced red onion*
- 1/4-1/3 cup of homemade red wine vinaigrette
directions:
- Turn on your oven's LOW broil setting and pop the naan bread pieces onto the middle
  rack. Warm & slightly toast each side for about 3-5 minutes, keeping an eye on them
  so they don't get too dark (I always set a timer). Alternately, you can warm the
  naan bread in a skillet on the stove or in a toaster oven if you don't want to turn
  on your oven.
- Meanwhile, prep the cucumber, tomatoes, and red onion and add the chopped veggies
  to a medium-sized bowl. Pour vinaigrette over the veggie mixture and toss the vegetables
  until they're well coated.
- Lay the naan bread pieces on a cutting board or baking sheet with the inside facing
  up (the side that's less charred).
- 'Prepare each naan wrap as follows: Spread 1/4 cup of hummus across the whole surface,
  place 1 cup of spring mix on half the naan, then the cooked shredded chicken on
  the other half. Scoop 1/2 cup of the veggie mixture on top of the salad mix (this
  helps to absorb a bit of the dressing), then crumble 1 tablespoon of feta cheese
  over the veggies.'
- Garnish each chicken wrap by pouring an extra tablespoon of red wine vinaigrette
  or juice from the bottom of the veggie bowl over the whole wrap, followed by sea
  salt & cracked black pepper (to taste) and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.
- Serve immediately while still flat (letting each person fold it themselves) OR for
  a nice presentation, tie a small length of hemp cord around each wrap beforehand.
