ingredients:
- 1.5 cups pearl couscous ($2.20)
- 1 fresh lemon ($0.89)
- 2 Tbsp olive oil ($0.32)
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder ($0.02)
- 1/4 tsp salt ($0.02)
- 1 English cucumber ($1.49)
- 1/4 bunch parsley ($0.27)
- 1/4 tsp freshly cracked pepper ($0.02)
- 3 oz. feta cheese, crumbled ($1.23)
directions:
- Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the couscous and continue to boil for about
  5 minutes, or until the couscous is tender. Drain the couscous in a colander or
  wire strainer. Rinse briefly with cool water to cool off the couscous, then allow
  to drain while you prepare the rest of the salad.
- Zest the lemon and then squeeze the juice. You'll need about Â½ tsp of zest and 3
  Tbsp of juice.
- Add the lemon juice, olive oil, garlic powder, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper
  to a bowl and stir to combine.
- Chop the cucumber into quarter-rounds and roughly chop the parsley.
- Add the cooled and drained couscous to a large bowl along with the cucumber, parsley,
  lemon zest, and feta. Pour the dressing over top, then stir to combine. Serve immediately
  or refrigerate until ready to eat.
