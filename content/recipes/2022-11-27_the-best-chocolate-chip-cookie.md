ingredients:
- 1½ cups (200 g) all-purpose flour (spooning into measuring cups, then leveling)
- 1¼ tsp. (4 g) Diamond Crystal or ¾ tsp. (4 g) Morton kosher salt
- ¾ tsp. (4 g) baking soda
- ¾ cup (1½ sticks; 169 g) unsalted butter, divided
- 1 cup (200 g) (packed) dark brown sugar
- ¼ cup (50 g) granulated sugar
- 1 large egg
- 2 large egg yolks
- 2 tsp. vanilla extract
- 6 oz. (170 g) bittersweet chocolate (60%–70% cacao), coarsely chopped, or semisweet
  chocolate chips
directions:
- Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 375°. Whisk flour, salt,
  and baking soda in a small bowl; set aside.
- Cook ½ cup (1 stick; 113 g) butter in a large saucepan over medium heat, swirling
  often and scraping bottom of pan with a heatproof rubber spatula, until butter foams,
  then browns, about 4 minutes. Transfer butter to a large heatproof bowl and let
  cool 1 minute. Cut remaining ¼ cup (½ stick; 56 g) butter into small pieces and
  add to brown butter (it should start to melt but not foam and sizzle, so test with
  one piece before adding the rest).
- Once butter is melted, add both sugars and whisk, breaking up any clumps, until
  sugar is incorporated and no lumps remain. Add egg and egg yolks and whisk until
  sugar dissolves and mixture is smooth, about 30 seconds. Whisk in vanilla. Using
  rubber spatula, fold reserved dry ingredients into butter mixture just until no
  dry spots remain, then fold in chocolate (the dough will be soft but should hold
  its shape once scooped; if it slumps or oozes after being scooped, stir dough back
  together several times and let rest 5–10 minutes until scoops hold their shape as
  the flour hydrates).
- 'Using a 1½-oz. scoop (3 Tbsp.), portion out 16 balls of dough and divide between
  2 parchment-lined rimmed baking sheets. Bake cookies, rotating sheets if cookies
  are browning very unevenly (otherwise, just leave them alone), until deep golden
  brown and firm around the edges, 8–10 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets. Do Ahead:
  Cookies can be made 3 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.'
