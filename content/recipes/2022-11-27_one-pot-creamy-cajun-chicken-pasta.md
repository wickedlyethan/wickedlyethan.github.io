ingredients:
- 2 tsp smoked paprika ($0.20)
- 1 tsp oregano ($0.10)
- 1 tsp thyme ($0.10)
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder ($0.05)
- 1/2 tsp onion powder ($0.05)
- 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper ($0.03)
- 1/4 tsp black pepper ($0.02)
- 1/4 tsp salt ($0.02)
- 1 Tbsp olive oil ($0.16)
- 1 Tbsp butter ($0.13)
- 1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breast ($5.47)
- 1 yellow onion, diced ($0.32)
- 1/2 lb. penne pasta (uncooked) ($0.75)
- 15 oz. fire roasted diced tomatoes ($1.00)
- 2 cups chicken broth ($0.26)
- 2 oz. cream cheese ($0.50)
- 3 green onions, sliced ($0.25)
directions:
- Combine the ingredients for the Cajun seasoning in a small bowl. Cut the chicken
  into 1/2 to 3/4-inch cubes. Place the cubed chicken in a bowl, pour the Cajun seasoning
  over top, and stir to coat the chicken in spices.
- Add the olive oil and butter to a large deep skillet. Heat the oil and butter over
  medium-high until the skillet is very hot and the butter is melted and foamy. Add
  the seasoned chicken to the skillet and cook for a couple minutes on each side,
  or just until the outside gets some color. The chicken does not need to be cooked
  through at this point.
- Add the diced yellow onion to the skillet and continue to saut√© for about 2 minutes
  more, or just until the onion begins to soften. Allow the moisture from the onion
  to dissolve any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.
- Next, add the pasta, fire roasted diced tomatoes (with the juices), and chicken
  broth to the skillet. Stir just until everything is evenly combined, then place
  a lid on top and allow the broth to come up to a boil.
- Once boiling, turn the heat down to medium-low and let the pasta simmer for about
  ten minutes, stirring every couple of minutes, until the pasta is tender and the
  liquid is thick and saucy.
- Add the cream cheese to the skillet in chunks, then stir until it has melted into
  the sauce. Top the pasta with sliced green onions and serve.
