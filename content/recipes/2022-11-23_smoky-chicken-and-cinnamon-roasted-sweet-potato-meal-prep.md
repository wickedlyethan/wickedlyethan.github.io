ingredients:
- 2 sweet potatoes (about 3/4 lb. each) ($1.49)
- 1 Tbsp cooking oil ($0.04)
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon ($0.05)
- pinch cayenne pepper ($0.02)
- pinch salt ($0.02)
- 1 tsp smoked paprika ($0.10)
- 1 tsp brown sugar ($0.02)
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder ($0.02)
- 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper ($0.02)
- 1/4 tsp salt ($0.02)
- freshly ground pepper ($0.02)
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 2/3 lb. each) ($6.42)
- 1 Tbsp cooking oil ($0.04)
- 1 lb. green beans ($0.99)
- 1 Tbsp butter ($0.12)
- pinch salt and pepper ($0.04)
directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Wash the sweet potatoes, pat them dry, and prick their
  skins a few times with a fork. Slice the sweet potatoes in half lengthwise, then
  place them on a baking sheet. Drizzle the cooking oil over the potatoes, then use
  your hands to smear the oil over their entire surface (skin and cut sides), leaving
  a liberal amount of oil on the baking sheet under the potatoes to keep them from
  sticking.
- Place the sweet potatoes with the cut side up, then sprinkle with cinnamon, a pinch
  of cayenne pepper, and a pinch of salt. Flip the sweet potatoes over so they are
  cut side down, then roast for 45-50 minutes, or until they are soft all the way
  through and the juices are caramelized and bubbling out of the holes in the skin.
- While the sweet potatoes are roasting, prepare the chicken and green beans. Combine
  the spices for the chicken in a small bowl (smoked paprika, brown sugar, garlic
  powder, cayenne, salt, and freshly ground pepper-about 20 cranks of a pepper mill).
- Pat the chicken dry, then sprinkle the spice rub over both sides. Heat a large skillet
  over medium, then add the cooking oil and swirl to coat the surface. Add the chicken
  and cook until they are deeply browned on each side and the internal temp has reached
  165ºF. Remove the chicken to a cutting board and let it rest.
- While the chicken is cooking, prepare the green beans. Add about one inch water
  to a sauce pot and place a steaming basket in the pot. Add the green beans to the
  basket, place a lid on top, and place them over medium-high heat. Allow the water
  to come up to a boil and steam the green beans for 7-10 minutes, or until they are
  bright green and only slightly softened.
- Remove the green beans from the pot, pour out the water, and place the beans back
  in the pot without the steaming basket. Add 1 Tbsp butter and allow the residual
  heat from the beans to melt the butter. Stir to coat, then season with a pinch of
  salt and pepper.
- Slice the chicken breasts into strips. Divide the sweet potato halves, green beans,
  and chicken between four containers or plates. Serve immediately or refrigerate
  and reheat later.
