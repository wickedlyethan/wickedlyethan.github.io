ingredients:
- 4 cups all-purpose flour ($0.59)
- 1/2 Tbsp salt ($0.05)
- 1/4 tsp instant yeast ($0.02)
- 2 cups water ($0.00)
- 2 Tbsp olive oil ($0.24)
- 2 Tbsp Italian seasoning ($0.30)
directions:
- The day before (about 18 hours ahead of time) combine the flour, salt, and yeast
  in a large bowl. Stir until well mixed. Add the water, starting with 1.5 cups, and
  add a little more at a time until the flour forms a cohesive, wet ball. There should
  not be any dry flour left on the bottom of the bowl. The total amount of water youâ€™ll
  need will vary, but should be between 1.5 to 2 cups. See the photos below for more
  info.
- Loosely cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature for
  16-18 hours to ferment.
- After 16-18 hours, the dough will look like a large, bubbly mass. Sprinkle with
  enough flour to be able to scrape it out of the bowl without it sticking to your
  hands. Place the dough on a well floured surface. Cut the dough into 12 pieces.
  Shape each piece into a small ball. The dough will be quite wet, floppy, and sticky,
  so sprinkle liberally with flour as you work.
- Place the rolls on a baking sheet covered in foil and lightly sprayed with non-stick
  spray (I used two baking sheets). Brush the top of each lightly with olive oil.
  Sprinkle the Italian seasoning over top. Let rise for 30 minutes to one hour or
  until doubled in size.
- While the rolls are still rising, preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Once it is fully
  preheated, place the rolls in the oven and bake until the surface is a light golden
  brown (about 25 minutes). Serve warm!
