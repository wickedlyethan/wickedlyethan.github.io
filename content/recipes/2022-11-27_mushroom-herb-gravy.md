ingredients:
- 3 Tbsp butter or cooking oil ($0.33)
- 2 cloves garlic ($0.16)
- 8 oz mushrooms ($1.99)
- 3 Tbsp all-purpose flour ($0.03)
- 2 cups vegetable broth ($0.25)
- 3 sprigs fresh thyme ($0.32)
- 1 tsp dried sage ($0.10)
- Salt and pepper to taste ($0.05)
directions:
- Rinse the mushrooms to remove any dirt or debris, then slice them thinly. Mince
  the garlic.
- Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and sauté for
  1-2 minutes or just until soft and fragrant. Add the sliced mushrooms and continue
  to sauté until they are soft, dark, and all of the moisture they release has evaporated
  (5 minutes).
- Make sure that all of the moisture released by the mushrooms has evaporated and
  just the butter oil and mushrooms remain in the pan. Turn the heat down to medium-low,
  add the flour, and continue to sauté the flour with the mushrooms and butter. The
  flour will form a paste like mixture all over the mushrooms and eventually begin
  to coat the bottom of the skillet. Continue to sauté for 3-4 minutes, or just until
  the flour begins to turn golden brown on the bottom of the skillet. This will slightly
  toast the flour and give the gravy better flavor.
- Slowly whisk in the vegetable broth. Whisk well to make sure that all of the flour
  has dissolved off the bottom of the skillet and no lumps remain. Add the sprigs
  of thyme, sage, and some freshly cracked pepper. Stir to combine.
- Allow the mixture to come to a simmer. The gravy will begin to thicken as soon as
  it simmers. Allow the gravy to simmer for 7-10 minutes, whisking often, until it
  is the desired thickness. Remember that the gravy will continue to thicken as it
  cools. Taste the gravy and adjust salt and pepper to your liking.
