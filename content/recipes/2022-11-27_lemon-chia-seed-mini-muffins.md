ingredients:
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons chia seeds
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1/4 cup milk
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter (melted)
- 2 teaspoons lemon zest
directions:
- Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and butter or grease mini muffin pan. Set
  aside.
- In a large bowl, whisk together flour, chia seeds, baking powder, baking soda, and
  salt. Set aside.
- In a separate bowl, add sugar, egg, milk, butter, and lemon zest. Mix until fully
  combined. Add wet mixture to dry mixture and stir until just combined.
- Fill mini muffin tins halfway with batter. Bake for 12-14 minutes, or until a toothpick

  a butter knife around the edges of the pan to loosen your muffins. Allow to cool
  completely before storing in a sealed container.
