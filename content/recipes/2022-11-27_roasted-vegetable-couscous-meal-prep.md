- 2 Tbsp butter, room temperature ($0.36)

- 1/2 cup ranch dressing ($0.70)
directions:
- Roasted Vegetable Couscous
- Prepare the Roasted Vegetable Couscous first. Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Chop the
  Roma tomatoes, zucchini, and bell pepper into 1-inch pieces. Slice the red onion
  into 1/2-inch thick strips. Place the tomatoes, zucchini, bell pepper, onion, and
  peeled garlic on a large baking sheet.
- Drizzle the olive oil over the chopped vegetables, toss to coat, then season with
  a couple pinches of salt and pepper. Roast the vegetables for about 45 minutes,
  stirring every 15 minutes or so.
- While the vegetables are roasting, begin the couscous. Bring the vegetable broth
  to a boil in a small sauce pot. Once boiling, stir in the couscous. Place a lid
  on top, remove the pot from the heat, and let the couscous sit for five minutes,
  or until all of the broth is absorbed. Fluff the couscous with a fork, then place
  in the refrigerator to begin cooling as you prepare the rest of the meal.
- For Garlic Herb Baked Chicken
- While the couscous is chilling, begin the garlic herb baked chicken. Combine the
  room temperature butter with the parsley, oregano, basil, garlic powder, onion powder,
  salt, and pepper in a bowl. Stir until it forms a paste.
- If the chicken breasts are thick, gently pound them with a mallet or rolling pin
  until they are an even thickness, no more than 3/4-inch thick (I cover the chicken
  with plastic to prevent splatter when pounding). Pat the chicken dry, then smear
  the butter herb mixture over the entire surface.
- Place the seasoned chicken in a baking dish and bake for 20 minutes at 400ºF, or
  until the internal temperature reaches 165ºF. Let the chicken rest for 5 minutes,
  then slice into strips.
- For Garlic Herb Chickpeas
- To make Garlic Herb Chickpeas instead, rinse and drain 2 15oz. cans of chickpeas.
  Heat 1 Tbsp oil in a large skillet over medium. Once hot, add the chickpeas, and
  sauté for about 5 minutes, or until the chickpeas are golden and the skins are blistered.
  Remove them from heat and then season with the same garlic herb spices used for
  the chicken (no butter). Stir until the chickpeas are coated in the herbs and spices.
- Assemble the Meal Prep
- When the vegetables are finally finished roasting, pull out the whole garlic cloves
  from the baking sheet and mince them. Combine the partially cooled couscous, the
  roasted vegetables, garlic, and chopped parsley in a large bowl. Stir to combine.
- Divide the Roasted Vegetable Couscous between four containers and top with sliced
  chicken or 1/4 of the Garlic Herb Chickpeas. Serve each portion with 2 Tbsp ranch
  dressing.
