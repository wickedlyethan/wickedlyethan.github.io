description: We are in love with this easy zucchini noodles recipe. There’s fresh
  zucchini, tomatoes, basil, parmesan, and garlic. Plus, it only takes 20 minutes
  to make. Make this with 100% zucchini noodles, or swap half of the zucchini for
  regular spaghetti for a heartier meal. For a vegetarian option, omit the parmesan
  cheese, substitute it with your favorite vegetarian-friendly cheese, or use nutritional
  yeast.

ingredients:
- 4 medium zucchini (about 2 pounds)
- 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic (3 to 4 cloves)
- 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, depending on how spicy you like the
  pasta
- 2 medium tomatoes, chopped, see note (about 12 ounces)
- 1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese, plus more for serving, see notes for alternatives
- 1 cup basil leaves, torn into pieces
- 1 teaspoon cornstarch
- 2 teaspoons cold water
- Salt, to taste
directions:
- Trim and spiralize the zucchini (see notes below for doing this without a spiralizer).
  Then cut the spiralized zucchini into long noodles to be about the length of spaghetti.
- Add olive oil, garlic, and the red pepper flakes to a large, deep skillet. Turn
  to medium heat. When the oil bubbles around the garlic, add the zucchini noodles.
- Toss the noodles with pasta tongs and cook until al dente — they should be wilted
  but still have a crunch; 5 to 7 minutes. Do not let the noodles cook any longer,
  or else they will become mushy. As they cook, keep tossing so that all the zucchini
  noodles have a chance to hit the bottom of the skillet.
- Stir in the tomatoes, basil, and parmesan cheese, and then cook for one minute.
  Use pasta tongs to transfer the noodles, tomatoes, and basil to a serving dish.
  Leave the liquid in the skillet.
- Bring the liquid left in the skillet to a simmer.
- Combine cornstarch and cold water in a small bowl, then whisk into the simmering
  liquid. Cook while whisking until the liquid thickens to a sauce; about 1 minute.
  Taste the sauce and season with salt.
- Pour the sauce over the zucchini, tomatoes, and basil. Finish with more parmesan
  cheese on top and serve immediately.
