description: I love all things Mexican. Food. Clothes. Little native villages perched
  high up in the mountains. In my home, taco meat and refried beans are veritable
  staples.Sadly, store bought taco seasoning is full of nasty stuff with an ingredients
  label that reads like a chemistry textbook. If you've been wondering how to replace
  those small packets of MSG-riddled spices with something real, you should give this
  recipe for homemade taco seasoning a try.
