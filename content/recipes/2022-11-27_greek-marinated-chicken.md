ingredients:
- 1 cup plain yogurt ($0.63)
- 2 Tbsp olive oil ($0.32)
- 4 cloves garlic, minced ($0.32)
- 1/2 Tbsp dried oregano ($0.08)
- 1 medium lemon ($0.49)
- 1/2 tsp salt ($0.02)
- freshly cracked pepper ($0.05)
- 1/4 bunch fresh parsley ($0.20)
- 3 1/2 to 4 lbs chicken pieces ($6.86)
directions:
- To make the marinade, combine the yogurt, olive oil, minced garlic, oregano, salt,
  and some freshly cracked pepper in a bowl. Use a fine holed cheese grater or a zester
  to scrape the thin layer of yellow zest from the lemon skin into the bowl. Also
  add the juice from half of the lemon (about 1-2 Tbsp). Stir until the ingredients
  are well combined. Roughly chop a big handful, or about 1/4 bunch, of parsley and
  stir it into the marinade.
- Add the chicken pieces and marinade to a gallon sized zip top bag. Remove as much
  air as possible, close the bag tightly, and massage the bag to mix the contents
  and make sure the chicken is well coated. Refrigerate the bag for 30 minutes.
- After marinating for 30 minutes, either cook the chicken on a grill OR preheat the
  oven to 375 degrees in preparation to bake the chicken.
- To bake the chicken, place the chicken pieces in a large casserole dish (9x13).
  Bake the chicken in the preheated 375 degree oven for 45-60 minutes, or until golden
  brown on top.
