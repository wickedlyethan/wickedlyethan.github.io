ingredients:
- 2 pounds ground turkey (93% lean)
- 1 cup bread crumbs
- 2/3 cup onion (minced)
- 1/2 cup fresh parsley (minced)
- 2 large eggs
- 3 cloves garlic (minced)
- 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
- 1/2 teaspoon dried basil
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1/4 cup olive oil
directions:
- 'To make the meatballs:'
- In a large bowl, combine ground turkey, bread crumbs, onion, parsley, eggs, garlic,
  Worcestershire sauce, basil, oregano, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
- Using a strong spatula or your hands (I like to wear latex gloves), mix well. Shape
  the mixture into 1-inch balls (you should have around 48 total).
- 'To bake the meatballs:'
- Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil for easy cleanup.
  Coat a wire rack with nonstick spray and set on prepared baking sheet.
- Arrange meatballs on rack, brush with oil, and bake until browned with crispy edges,
  about 15 to 20 minutes (an internal thermometer should read 165 degrees for 15 seconds).
- 'To fry the meatballs:'
- Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the meatballs in batches
  until browned on all sides and the meatballs are cooked, about 5 to 7 minutes per
  batch (an internal thermometer should read 165 degrees for 15 seconds). Add more
  oil between batches if the skillet looks dry.
- 'To freeze the meatballs:'
- Arrange in a single layer on a baking sheet, not touching. Freeze until solid, about
  1 hour, then transfer to a freezer-safe container and store up to 1 month.
