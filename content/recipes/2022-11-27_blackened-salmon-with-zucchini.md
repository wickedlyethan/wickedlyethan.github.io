ingredients:
- 2 tsp smoked paprika ($0.20)
- 1 tsp dried thyme ($0.10)
- 1 tsp dried oregano ($0.10)
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin ($0.05)
- 1/4 tsp cayenne ($0.02)
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder ($0.05)
- 1/2 tsp onion powder ($0.02)
- 1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper ($0.02)
- 1/4 tsp salt ($0.02)
- 1.3 lbs. salmon ($10.65)
- 2 Tbsp butter ($0.26)
- 1 Tbsp cooking oil ($0.04)
- 1.3 lbs. zucchini ($1.79)
directions:
- Make Seasoning
- Combine the spices for the Cajun seasoning in a bowl (smoked paprika, thyme, oregano,
  cumin, cayenne, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper).
- Season Salmon
- Remove the skin from the salmon, then cut it into four equal-sized portions (if
  not already cut). Generously coat all sides of the fish in the prepared Cajun seasoning.
- Chop Zucchini
- Slice the zucchini into half-rounds and set aside.
- Cook Salmon
- Add the butter and cooking oil to a skillet and heat over medium-high. When the
  skillet is hot and the butter is melted and foaming, add the salmon pieces. Cook
  the salmon for 5-7 minutes on each side, or until a dark brown crust forms and the
  salmon is cooked through*.
- Cook Zucchini
- Remove the cooked fish to a clean plate. Add the sliced zucchini to the skillet
  in its place. Quickly sauté the zucchini in the residual butter and spices until
  it is tender. Serve the salmon and zucchini immediately.
