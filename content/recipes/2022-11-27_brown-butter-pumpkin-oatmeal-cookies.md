ingredients:
- 1 cup (2 sticks; 230g) unsalted butter
- 2 cups (170g) old-fashioned whole rolled oats
- 1 and 2/3 (209g) cup all-purpose flour (spoon & leveled)
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 and 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 and 1/2 teaspoons store-bought or homemade pumpkin pie spice*
- 1 cup (200g) granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup (150g) packed light or dark brown sugar
- 1 egg yolk, at room temperature
- 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- 1 cup (228g) pumpkin puree (see note – not pumpkin pie filling and not the whole
  can)*
- 1/4 cup (60g) unsalted butter
- 1 and 1/2 cups (180g) confectioners’ sugar
- 3 Tablespoons (45ml) milk
- 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
directions:
- Important before you begin!
- If topping the cookies with the brown butter icing, you can brown the butter for
  both the cookies AND the icing together. Once it is all browned, set 2 liquid ounces
  (1/4 volume cup) aside for the glaze. You can use it in step 8. The rest (about
  8 liquid ounces) is for the cookies, used in step 5.
- Brown the butter
- Slice the butter up into pieces and place in a light-colored skillet. (Light colored
  helps you determine when the butter begins browning.) Melt the butter over medium
  heat, stirring constantly. Once melted, the butter will begin to foam. Keep stirring.
  After 5–8 minutes, the butter will begin browning—you’ll notice lightly browned
  specks begin to form at the bottom of the pan and it will have a nutty aroma. See
  photo above for a visual. Once browned, immediately remove from heat and cool for
  5 minutes.
- Meanwhile, whisk the oats, flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice
  together in a medium bowl.
- Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper
  or silicone baking mats. Set aside.
- Pour the slightly cooled brown butter into a large bowl. Whisk in the granulated
  sugar and brown sugar until combined. Whisk in the egg yolk and vanilla extract
  until combined, then whisk in the blotted pumpkin (see note about blotting). Slowly
  mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until combined. The cookie dough
  will be thick and sticky.
- Using a medium cookie scoop, scoop cookie dough into balls (about 2 heaping Tbsp
  of dough each) and place 3 inches apart on the cookie sheet. Slightly flatten the
  balls out– see picture above– as the cookies won’t spread much unless you help out
  first!
- Bake for 14–15 minutes or until lightly browned and set on the edges. Remove from
  the oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes on the cookie sheet before icing.
- Make the icing
- Give the 1/4 cup of brown butter you reserved for the icing a quick stir. If it’s
  no longer thin and liquid, warm it on the stove or in the microwave until liquid
  again. Whisk in the remaining icing ingredients until smooth. Dip the top of each
  cookie into the icing.
