ingredients:
- 2/3 lb. salmon filet ($6.59)
- 2/3 lb. fresh green beans ($0.80)
- 3 Tbsp soy sauce ( $0.30)
- 1 Tbsp water ($0.00)
- 2 Tbsp rice wine (mirin) ($0.27)
- 2 Tbsp brown sugar ($0.04)
- 1/2 Tbsp toasted sesame oil ($0.85)
- 1 clove garlic, minced ($0.08)
- 1 inch fresh ginger, grated or minced ($0.11)
- 1 Tbsp sesame seeds ($0.15)
- 1 Tbsp cornstarch ($0.04)
directions:
- In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, water, rice wine, brown sugar, sesame oil,
  garlic, ginger, sesame seeds, and cornstarch. Stir until the cornstarch is dissolved.
- Remove the scales and/or skin from the salmon, if needed. Cut the salmon into three
  equal sized pieces and place them in a quart-sized zip top bag. Add about half of
  the marinade to the bag and let the fish marinate for about 15 minutes. Save the
  second half of the marinade for later.
- While the fish is marinating, snap the stems off the beans and break any long beans
  in half. Rinse the beans in a colander. Add the beans to a medium sauce pot, cover
  with water, add a lid, and bring to a boil over high heat. Allow the beans to boil
  until bright green and slightly tender (about 3 minutes), then drain in the colander
  and set aside.
- Lightly mist a non-stick skillet with non-stick spray and heat over medium-low flame.
  Once hot, add the salmon pieces and cook on each side until the glaze turns deep
  brown and the fish is cooked through (about 3-5 minutes each side). Removed the
  cooked salmon to a clean plate.
- Add the drained green beans to the skillet that was used to cook the salmon, along
  with the remaining unused marinade. Saut√© the green beans in the marinade until
  it thickens to a shiny glaze and completely coats the green beans (about 3 minutes).
  Serve the fish on top of the glazed green beans.
