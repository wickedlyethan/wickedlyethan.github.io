Work has been bizarre but better, but I'm still fighting to make the project I work on something I'm proud of. Meanwhile we desperately need to get out of this apartment – we live in a neighborhood so noise-polluted that I wear noise-cancelling headphones most of the day, which in turn gives me a migraine that can ruin my evenings. I'm closer than ever to really diving into my dream fiction project, if not just as a way to get away from everything.

I've started my new technical writing job and have been thrown into the deep end of very corporate, big-scale software development. It's a strange, arcane world but I'm getting a grasp on it quickly enough, and I'm good enough at what I do that I have no problems actually doing my job.

I'm still working on my **forever project**, which is downsizing our apartment and getting rid of stuff – we're in the phase of our life where we're shucking away all the hand-me-downs and stuff we combined when we moved together in college. It's really hard sometimes, but it's all in service of having less anxiety about how much we have and how hard it would be to move.

I just resigned from the longest job I've ever had after getting recruited for a much better/cooler/higher-paying opportunity! I'm nervous and excited and am having a real hard time giving a damn for the last two weeks I begrudgingly gave.

Meanwhile I'm desperately awaiting warmer weather and turning 30 in a few weeks, which is a bit harrowing but mostly exciting.
