I've started my new technical writing job and have been thrown into the deep end of very corporate, big-scale software development. It's a strange, arcane world but I'm getting a grasp on it quickly enough, and I'm good enough at what I do that I have no problems actually doing my job.

I'm still working on my **forever project**, which is downsizing our apartment and getting rid of stuff â€“ we're in the phase of our life where we're shucking away all the hand-me-downs and stuff we combined when we moved together in college. It's really hard sometimes, but it's all in service of having less anxiety about how much we have and how hard it would be to move.

I just resigned from the longest job I've ever had after getting recruited for a much better/cooler/higher-paying opportunity! I'm nervous and excited and am having a real hard time giving a damn for the last two weeks I begrudgingly gave.

Meanwhile I'm desperately awaiting warmer weather and turning 30 in a few weeks, which is a bit harrowing but mostly exciting.
