I've started my new technical writing job and have been thrown into the deep end of very corporate, big-scale software development. It's a strange, arcane world but I'm getting a grasp on it quickly enough, and I'm good enough at what I do that I have no problems actually doing my job.

My **forever project** is downsizing our apartment and getting rid of stuff â€“ we're in the phase of our life where we're shucking away all the hand-me-downs and stuff we combined when we moved together in college. It's really hard sometimes, but it's all in service of having less anxiety about how much we have and how hard it would be to move.
