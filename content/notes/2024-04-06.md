I know Marvel Discourse™️ is considered indescribably lame, but I'm watching *Captain America: Civil War* (2016) because I got it on 4k for very little, and there's a lot to say about these early Russo brothers films! The techno-thriller vibes, the nasty and up-close fight and stunt choreography, the centering of two deeply flawed men as the protagonists/id/ego of all superheroes in general. It's both really damn good and already so Of Its Time already (oh gods it's almost ten years old ugh). A fun fact and perhaps an early barometer of how this flavor was getting stale even at the time: *Finding Dory* made $26 million more in the box office and became the highest grossing movie of the year instead.
