An ode to the humble space heater: you’re a marvel of simple engineering [widely misunderstood](https://youtu.be/HnMuNCl7tZ8?si=rc6KK1AtdV8G3OaW) as routinely dangerous when really, people are kind of dumb and plug you into dollar store extension cords. It’s not your fault you’re trying your best to fight the frost and only know how to do it the [one way](https://youtu.be/V-jmSjy2ArM?si=_sWTiLZH24ZplhiX). Luckily there are folks on YouTube performing obsessively in-depth safety tests [in their garages](https://youtu.be/ND2mrzPnBic?si=uS2YkWIQZmKvSO3T) and I only had to watch a weird amount of them before [finally picking](https://www.dreo.com/products/solaris-max-2nd-gen-space-heater) a tower of power for my home office. 

For the first time since the winter solstice I can feel all my finger tips and uncurl my hunched back, my brain thawing out every morning with very strong black tea. I have no compunction about running this thing at 70 degrees while the cats sleep on blankets with the cast iron radiators down to 66. It’s not a perfect implementation of heating [people, not places](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/02/restoring-the-old-way-of-warming-heating-people-not-places/), but it’s better than misery and it’s an important tool towards [better wintering]({{<relref "/blog/2025-12-09-weeknotes-2025-50">}}).
