It sucks living through an American *perestroika*. Mark Carney’s [historic Davos speech](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/carney-davos-speech-9.7052725) had the text of pragmatic cooperation between middle powers to insulate themselves from capricious great powers, and it had a subtext of "forget the US, leave them behind". We should all be afraid of a future where America is a pariah and Americans deliberately forgotten; collapsing empires don’t lead to liberated citizens. In its death throes how much worse will it get? In its absurd way, our TVs will stay cheap while we’re further ground under the heel of feudal lords. 

What wouldn’t I give to have been born in a country that wasn’t the center of the stupid world, and how happy would I be to elect someone with a platform of groveling to the globe for one hundred years.
