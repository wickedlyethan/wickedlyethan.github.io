Feeling like a wizard right now. I downloaded [M4's *The Hobbit* Book Edit](https://m4studios.github.io/hobbit-book-edit/) after the good time I had with Pentex Productions' [*Mission Impossible: The Final Editing*]({{<relref "/notes/2025/2025-12-27.md">}}), but the 4.2 hour epic is delivered in barely compressed high quality, a hefty 24 GB.

That's multiple times larger than I want to keep around on the NAS; I dusted off my FFmpeg notes and did some digging to learn how to use my RTX 2070 Super's horsepower to get things going. NVENC support is widespread and Bazzite comes with it as part of the installed NVIDIA drivers, so I didn't have to do any fussing to get it working.

I shot for a quality setting right down the middle using a constant quality (`cq`) setting of 22 out of 28 and in about ten minutes I had cut the behemoth in half with no damage done to the frame as far as my pixel-peeping was concerned.

Here's my command, nothing special at all once I remembered I needed to bring over everything in the Matroska:

```shell
ffmpeg -i input.mkv -map 0 -c:v hevc_nvenc -cq 22 -c:a copy -c:s copy -c:d copy -c:t copy output.mkv
```

The jury's out on the edit itself – can anything save *The Hobbit* [from itself?](https://youtu.be/uTRUQ-RKfUs?si=waQ_7eam94dKXKMP) – but I was happy with how easy it was to make a solid improvement in file size without any discernible drop in quality.
