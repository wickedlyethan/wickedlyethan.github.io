I really like Chuck Wendig's yearly writing resolution posts, but [this year's](https://terribleminds.com/ramble/2025/12/31/writer-resolution-2026-wield-the-weapon-that-is-you/) goes extra hard, so I'm leave this here for future reference.

> In a sense, most of my annual resolutions are probably some version of this: write who you are, fuck trends, get weird, and especially this year, fuck the machine. But this year I want you to not only implement that but also to do it with hope in your heart and spite in your teeth. I want you to be the best, weirdest version of yourself you can be. Turn off all your sad bummer imposter worries, shut down your doubts. Demolish the guardrails and kick over the road closed signs. Get weird with it. Get YOU with it. I want to see that on the page. We all want to see that on the page.
