So, to catch up on TikTok:

- Congress passed a [law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protecting_Americans_from_Foreign_Adversary_Controlled_Applications_Act) requiring TikTok's parent company divest from its Chinese owners or get banned back in *2024*.
- Trump signed an executive order to tell the government to just... not enforce the ban. Ignore Congress and the people's representatives, just nah.
- Last week a deal was reached where Oracle (a.k.a noted fuckhead Larry Ellison), Silver Lake (the company that recently bought EA), and a investment firm [created by](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGX_Fund_Management_Limited) the United Arab Emirates focused on AI all now "operate" the US version of TikTok.
- TikTok immediately [crashes for multiple days](https://www.theverge.com/news/867625/tiktok-down-weekend-broke-fyp-video-uploads-review), which the new company blames on power outages at data centers.
- Now it sure looks like TikTok US is censoring or [suppressing anti-Trump and anti-ICE content](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgjedpn8p8o).

To be insufferable about it, I never liked TikTok, but I understood its power during the pandemic – the algorithm delivered a beautifully diverse crowd of trans, autistic, and disabled folks I normally wouldn’t see and that was cool! But the dark patterns were built in and every other app chasing TikTok has made them all worse; vertical video hell is now inescapable, a new default brain-drainer perfectly engineered for our omnipresent phones.

Put the platform itself aside and I can’t stop thinking about how the TikTok “ban” is one of the dumbest yet most insidious examples of the kneecapping of basic American governance. The president instructed the government to ignore Congress, the representatives of the people, and not enforce legislation that previous president signed into law, and nothing happened. He did this so he could make sure one of his favorite people, one of the richest people in the world, could get an ownership stake in a dominant new form of communication, to what end we shall see. They knew they never had to make a compelling case, they just did it.
