Blog posts about how shit macOS 26 (ugh) Tahoe is are doing numbers over on Hacker News. They’re reinforcing my abstinence from upgrading and that I’m not crazy, Liquid Glass is bad! I knew it from the moment I saw it that it’s a fundamentally bad idea; transparency is a stupid design ethos when computers are stacks of opaque content. Anyways, here are the latest deep dives into how big this unprompted error of an update is:

- [The struggle of resizing windows on macOS Tahoe – no.heger](https://noheger.at/blog/2026/01/11/the-struggle-of-resizing-windows-on-macos-tahoe/)
- [It’s hard to justify Tahoe icons @ tonsky.me](https://tonsky.me/blog/tahoe-icons/)
- [Icons in Menus Everywhere — Send Help - Jim Nielsen’s Blog](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/icons-in-menus/)
- [Last Week on My Mac: Tahoe’s elephant – The Eclectic Light Company](https://eclecticlight.co/2025/10/12/last-week-on-my-mac-tahoes-elephant/)

I’m annoyed on multiple levels: I hate bad design, and I associate Apple with good design; I hate the idea of macOS being harder to do “real computing” on, because it's my primary OS for doing real computing; and I only made the switch to full-time mac usage two years ago, so I arrived just in time for everything to get worse. Frustrating!

The silver lining is macOS doesn’t *force* you to upgrade, so I’ll chill on Sequoia for as long as I can because it’s the most enjoyable OS I’ve used since Windows 7.
