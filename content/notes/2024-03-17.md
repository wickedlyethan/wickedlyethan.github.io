I'll probably write a proper post about this at some point, but in "launching" yet another new design for my site (hopefully this one will stick, I actually built it for content, now I just need to make content!) I looked at tons of inspiration. Here's some of it: the [Own Your Website newsletter](https://buttondown.email/ownyourweb/archive/) by Matthias Ott, [Dead Simple Sites](https://deadsimplesites.com/) by Arcade Labs, ["100 things you can do on your personal website"](https://jamesg.blog/2024/02/19/personal-website-ideas/) by James Coffee, and of course my dear friend [nathan wentworth's](https://nathanwentworth.co/) personal site. The breakthrough came, however, from remembering the perfection that is [Indexhibit](https://www.indexhibit.org/), which I obviously took tons of inspiration from.
