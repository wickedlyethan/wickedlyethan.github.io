I continue to be delighted and amazed by the power and flexibility of the [Steam Deck](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck). The first gaming desktop I ever bought – a custom-built, sound-deadened monster from [Digital Storm](https://www.digitalstorm.com/) – came with *Far Cry 4* (2014) as a free code with the Nvidia GTX 970. I set the massive machine up on my childhood desk and it almost buckled with the weight; now I can play the same game on a hand-held machine using less than 15 watts of power.

Is it without compromises? Heck no! Are these random softwares and [scripts on GitHub](https://github.com/moraroy/NonSteamLaunchers-On-Steam-Deck) to get it all working part of the weird fun? Indubitably. I don't take it as far as some – tinkering isn't my primary mode of enjoyment with the Deck – but it sure is part of the appeal, especially at a time when I'm not finding a groove with any game I try. Nonetheless it's fun to spend an hour or two digging around, dusting off the game that taught me the phrase "Ludo-narrative Dissonance", and sit back on the couch with it for a bit, if only for that long.
