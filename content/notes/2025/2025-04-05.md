I picked up an M4 Air earlier this week – I'll admit, it was a tariff panic-buy – and I'm impressed with the machine, but I think I’m even more impressed by all the tech that makes switching machines a lot easier than it used to be.

I’ve written about [winget]({{<relref "/blog/2024-09-28 reinstall windows with ctt and microwin.md">}}) for Windows, but where there’s a Windows application there’s a Mac version that’s been doing it better. Now I learn that not only can you use Homebrew to [automate](https://docs.brew.sh/Brew-Bundle-and-Brewfile) installing open-source apps, but fonts, Visual Studio Code extensions, and even the [App Store](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas)?! One text file and everything I need is up and running in a matter of minutes. As a kid I used to spend *hours* setting up Windows and installing everything, entire afternoons of watching progress bars. Look how far we’ve come.

Meanwhile web apps continue to find great ways to get you logged in: scanning a QR code for Discord, storing the secret key for 1Password in your Apple keychain, using a passkey for Google. I created a cause-and-effect chain of signing into things in the right sequence that tickled my brain greatly, and again, got me set up in *an* hour, not plural. That’s what it’s all about.
