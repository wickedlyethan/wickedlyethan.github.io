I'm shocked to find a game I can *only* play on Steam Deck: after all the years and memes, *Skyrim* is still an excellent video game, and the 2022 special edition release fixed enough quality of life problems that it's more than playable, it's damned enjoyable.

That is until you put on anything larger than a 7" monitor at arm's length. The Steam Deck ergonomics mitigate FOV issues that my weird eyes have (everything has to be 110 degrees now, am I rapidly decaying?) and makes the narrow, swinging, slouchy camera comfortable for more than two dozen hours so far. Yet another reason to shun my Windows desktop and return to the couch with the ultimate form factor â€“ games are meant to be in your hands.
