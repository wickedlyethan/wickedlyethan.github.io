You can't know what you don't know... about self-hosting software! My stack isn't super complicated nor does it feel fragile, but there definitely is a never-ending thought train of "could I be doing this better?", and that's before something *does* break and you realize you definitely can.

Case in point our internet stopped resolving and it turns out I never changed the default DNS upstream server, nor added a fallback, to my [AdGuard](https://adguard.com/en/welcome.html) instance. A couple of clicks fixed that, but I'm not going to pretend I didn't try a bunch of other things first. And here I was dreaming of levelling up to a [mini-rack](https://mini-rack.jeffgeerling.com/) and everything.
