All respect to Anthony Horowitz – [Stormbreaker](https://anthonyhorowitz.com/books/title/stormbreaker) was a huge deal when I was a kid – but his take on Daniel Craig's 007 dying at the end of the slog that was *No Time to Die* (2021) is [hilariously misguided](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/news/james-bond-anthony-horowitz-script-b2832724.html).

> “The last time we saw Bond he was poisoned and blown to smithereens – how will they get past the fact he is dead with a capital D?”

As the Independent helpfully points out a line later: "The new Bond film won’t follow on from *No Time to Die*, instead serving as a relaunch of the 007 series with a new actor in the lead role."

Yeah dude! It's 007, it's not that deep! Killing Daniel Craig was an obvious, relatively elegant way to wrap that shit up so you can start over with none of the baggage. If *I* were asked to write a James Bond movie tomorrow, the whole thrill of it would be – and to be clear, you could have done this anytime, because they did it for the first 30 years or so – not giving a single shit about what came before.

The real problem is that James Bond as a film franchise doesn't have a place in the cinematic landscape, given its allegedly mandatory component parts. It couldn't beat *Mission Impossible* as the "bonkers stunt movies", because you can't beat Tom Cruise at that game (and even that didn't work out well for the last two *MI* movies). It can't be a smart geopolitical thriller because that requires name-dropping entities like Russia and China to make it real, which threatens box office returns. It can’t be a small-scale cat and mouse game like [*The Night Manager*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1399664/) because the budget will inevitably be oversized. The surprisingly fun [*Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5177120/) got freaky and has sinew in its teeth the whole time; one of the side characters is literally Ian Fleming.

James Bond, as I see it, was always Cold War pastiche, a fun house mirror version of John Le Carré. What could that possibly look like now, with a main character wielding a global “license to kill”? On one side of the spectrum is *Sicario* and the other is *John Wick*: have fun finding the middle and then trying to write that character *sexy*.
