I love to recommend the daily animal guessing game [Metazooa](https://metazooa.com/), especially if you're a zoo nerd like me. You have 20 tries to guess the mystery animal of the day, starting with a shot in the dark and then turning to process of elimination via the deliciousy dorky taxonomic tree entries the game links to. I love combing through the Wikipedia entries, learning about animal groups and what weird edge cases exist in every category. Emily informs me that "humans are legally a lobe-finned fish" (*Sarcopterygii*).
