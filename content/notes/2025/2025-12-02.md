The dream is finally real. After years of trying to have a good TV gaming experience with a PC, I finally got it all working. I continued my Ship of Theseus method and built most of a new PC into a [Lian Li A3](https://lian-li.com/product/a3-matx/) Micro ATX case and plugged it straight into our TV, which shockingly supports 120 hz with a variable refresh rate, and it all *works*. I played *Uncharted 4: A Thief's End* (2016) last night at 100 FPS with no noticeable latency **on Linux**.

It's been ten years since the release of the original Steam Link, which was a piece of crap, and a few years of trying to put up with the Steam Deck as a couch computer (it isn't powerful enough), and as always the answer is as simple as possible. A computer, plugged into a display. That's it.
