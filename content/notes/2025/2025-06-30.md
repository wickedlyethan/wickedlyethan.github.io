I'm learning to like iced coffee a lot for a summer-time caffeine fix – my customary cup of Yorkshire Gold ([Florence Pugh's favorite tea](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9FJd0Sl5kZ/?hl=en)) isn't as pleasant when it's almost 100℉ – and I am over the moon with how this iced café au lait came out this morning.

The oat milk frothed beautifully because there's less inhibiting fat content and oat milk doesn't need to be steamed to break down lactose into simpler sugars to get some extra sweetness like whole milk. Cold frothed oat milk is glorious and reminded me for a moment of a blissful glass of horchata I had years ago at a tiny taco joint in college. Why yes I am writing my life story before the recipe.

This came out rich and wonderfully layered, each sip perfumed with cinnamon that then mixed into the foam at the very end for a sweet and light finish. Absolutely delicious.

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup cold black coffee
- 1/2 cup cold oat milk
- 1 tsp sugar (optional)
- 2 tbsp ice (~2 ice cubes)
- Pinch of cinnamon

## Procedure

1) Pour oat milk and sugar, if desired, into a glass and use a [milk-frother](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/produkt-milk-frother-black-30301167/) to mix and foam the milk until about doubled in volume.
2) Tilt the glass and gently pour in the coffee, trying not to disturb the foam.
3) Slide in the ice cubes.
4) Put a pinch of cinnamon on top of the foam and enjoy!
