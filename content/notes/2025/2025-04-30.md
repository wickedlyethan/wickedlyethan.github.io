*The Verge* [reports](https://www.theverge.com/news/658584/up-to-30-percent-of-some-microsoft-code-is-now-written-by-ai) that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said vague nonsense about up to 30% of Microsoft’s code being written “by software”. 

I bet that’s bullshit – it would take astonishing idiocy to use generative AI to write the code that, regrettably, runs the world – but let’s pretend for a moment it’s true. If 30% of Windows, a bloated, frustrating OS already, is one-third vibe-coded, why the fuck should anyone trust it? Why would I want this as my daily-driver operating system, where I do all my work and play? The platform where I do my most sensitive transactions and tasks? Eff that noise, I’ll avoid Windows like the plague it’s become.
