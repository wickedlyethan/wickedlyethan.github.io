I have a condition where I get songs so stuck in my head that it makes it hard to have an original thought; the same thirty seconds will loop over and over until suddenly it'll disappear. Anyways, I have the [intro to *Peacemaker*](https://youtu.be/_mrr3UNALww?feature=shared) lodged in my brain, partly because of the aforementioned condition, partly because I'm shocked that James Gunn is the only person in Hollywood allowed to have a personality.
