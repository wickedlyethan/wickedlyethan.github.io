Example #5,242,678 of the United States being inexplicably stupid and worse than actual civilized countries:

Skin cancer is the [most common form of cancer](https://www.cdc.gov/skin-cancer/statistics/index.html) in the US, but the Federal Drug Administration hasn’t cleared ingredients used in sunscreen around the world because of a [law from 1938](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Food,_Drug,_and_Cosmetic_Act_of_1938). Despite a separate law passed in 2014 – the [Sunscreen Innovation Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunscreen_Innovation_Act) – only now is the FDA *considering* adding a single drug, [bemotrizinol](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-new-sunscreen-ingredient-review-bemotrizinol/), to the list of "generally recognized as safe and effective" sunscreen ingredients (it has a deadline of July, 2026). Bemotrizinol has been used in sunscreens in Europe and Asia since 2000!

Shit like this is why we can’t have nice things. The last time I fell into a regulation rabbit-hole this deep it was because I found out mattress covers can contain *fiberglass* in them, and if not handled perfectly it can go [very fucking wrong](https://youtu.be/xGQbpr131aU?si=qWYqVShfy_xLVQdf).  Some tiny good news there – California has voted to ban fiberglass in [mattresses and upholstered furniture](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CCDPHP/DEODC/EHIB/Pages/EIS/Factsheet-on-Fiberglass-and-Mattresses.aspx), but it won’t be in effect until 2027, if we’re all still here by then.
