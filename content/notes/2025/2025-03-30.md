We're **finally** moving out of our dark, beige apartment and Emily invited me to her Pinterest board to throw together design aspirations. It's been a long time since I've signed up for a new web service â€“ I avoid making accounts if at all possible, "Checkout as Guest" is my friend â€“Â but I was baffled to find Pinterest *requires* users to provide a gender identity and explicitly says they'll curate algorithmic content based on it. 

I reluctantly selected "male" and prepared myself for the cringe, but woof:

Not pictured but present: "Soldier", "Modified Cars", "NFL", "Survival Tips". ðŸ¤®

I'm not fully equipped to think about the intersection of gender politics and algorithms, and there's a lot to unpack here, but this is pretty bad! No thanks!
