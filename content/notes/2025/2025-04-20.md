Feeling incredibly grateful today. I have lots of weird feelings about my birthday, mostly around not feeling worth celebrating, but one of the weird things about your birthday is that it doesn’t really matter what you think; the people in your life will reach out and let you know that *they* think you’re worth celebrating, and few things feel better. I got to hang out with family and eat a decadent chocolate cake that Emily made from scratch, and that’s all I could ever ask for.
