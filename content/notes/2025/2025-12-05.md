After being dramatic about [losing trust]({{<relref "/blog/2025-08-17-firefox-failed-us.md">}}) in Firefox over AI features and general stagnation, I gave Kagi’s [Orion](https://orionbrowser.com/) a try and didn’t make it a full week. I was never under the impression that building a web browser was *easy*, per se, but I didn’t realize how my deeply ingrained habits are an ephemeral lock-in.

Yes, Orion supports most of my favorite extensions, but not all of them. The ones it does support are janky, like 1Password not responding or being able to reliably fill out fields, [Unhook](https://unhook.app/) not displaying its settings at all, or [Leechblock](https://www.proginosko.com/leechblock/) bugging out. The browser is itself a touch busy and unpolished, even with its 1.0 release.

Between those extensions and ten-plus years of using Firefox, I’m used to my internet looking and feeling a certain way under the cursor. I know the timings of Gecko and how it loads pages, I have rhythms of routines that got all thrown off. I found this interesting and frustrating in turn; I’ve put myself here, apparently forever. Then again, there hasn’t been anywhere better to go, and that hasn’t changed yet.
