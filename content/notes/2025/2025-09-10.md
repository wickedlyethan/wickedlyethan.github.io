I liked Fernando Bornetti’s [“Notes on Managing ADHD”](https://borretti.me/article/notes-on-managing-adhd) and its matter-of-factness about a condition that is misunderstood and moralized. They include a few delicious turns of phrase that I’m finding useful:

- “A todo list is a neuroprosthesis that augments long-term memory for tasks.”
- “To me, energy is less like a battery and more like voltage. Some machines require a threshold voltage to operate. Below that voltage they don’t just operate slower, they don’t operate at all. Analogously, different categories of activity have different threshold voltages.”
- “To remember something, put it in your visual field. Dually: to forget, get it out of sight.”
