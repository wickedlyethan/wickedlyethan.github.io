The new [Raspberry Pi 500+](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/raspberry-pi-supercharges-its-keyboard-pc-with-16gb-ram-ssd-mechanical-switches/) looks like a cool computer-in-a-keyboard, perfect for a kid’s first computer or an elderly person’s simplest computer, but I can’t find a single YouTuber covering it in a way that feels realistic to me! [ExplainingComputers](https://youtu.be/FOewqaDiynI?feature=shared) seemed impressed that it could play a 1080p video without stuttering, [ETA Prime](https://youtu.be/V_58fc9YrzA?feature=shared) opened a single tab of DuckDuckGo in Chromium, and [Jeff Geerling](https://youtu.be/Dv3RRAx7G6E?feature=shared) hooked it up to a freaking eGPU!

I want to see a benchmark of a middle schooler writing a Google doc for a paper due tomorrow morning while listening to lo-fi on Spotify and chatting on Discord, or your grand-père logging into his Fidelity account and opening a LibreOffice document to find his password. That’s what real computing looks like.
