A baffling backlash-to-the-backlash around AI’s power and water usage comes in the form of the deceivingly optimistic, deliberately obtuse pro-AI “don’t worry about it” take. MIT Technology Review, for example, says [“In the end, capitalism may save us after all”](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116337/ai-energy-use-optimism/) because AI companies will simply have to develop more efficient models, data center cooling, and computer chips somehow, someday. Other sneering blog posts, the kind that make it to Pinboard’s [popular feed](https://pinboard.in/popular) or Hacker News and then disappear, are offended you’d even ask, carrying water (pun intended) for their prophet Sam Altman, who himself tweeted a favorable comparison to the water required to [create a hamburger](https://x.com/sama/status/1890820962993533232).

To take a moment to fall for and refute their idiotic straw man:

1) As we all know, everyone agrees that creating beef is a super-efficient, climate-friendly practice that we’re all advocating to be the future of food.
2) Hamburgers, problematic as they are, feed people, who then can do anything in the possibility space of being a person, and for now people are worth more shitty software.

To take on the actual issue, being scolded into hand-waiving generative AI companies’ resource hunger:

1) *Any* electricity and water usage to power generative AI is *cumulative* – there are dozens of models and hundreds companies investing pedal-to-the-metal on generative AI *on top of* the existing power needs of data centers around the world, which [is a lot](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/04/power-hungry-ai-is-putting-the-hurt-on-global-electricity-supply/).
2) *Any* electricity and water usage to power generative AI implicitly endorses it and claims that it is *worth spending resources on*. I refute that premise already, but the burden is on the shakers and movers – and their pretentious, sneering, blogging toadies – to prove it. They’re doing a shit job.

You know who is worrying about needing more energy for AI? *The companies making it*. Google is single-handedly [resurrecting nuclear power](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/google-kairos-power-nuclear-energy-agreement/) for its data centers, and Meta’s new data center in Louisiana – [a “black hole of energy use”](https://www.404media.co/a-black-hole-of-energy-use-metas-massive-ai-data-center-is-stressing-out-a-louisiana-community/) – includes “three new Meta-subsidized, gas power plants”. xAI got the Memphis authorities to sign an NDA to hide how their future data center is [poisoning the community](https://time.com/7021709/elon-musk-xai-grok-memphis/). The titans of industry who are convinced this is the turning point to evolve from ad peddlers to purveyors of digital gods are giddily building their Mako reactors.

~~It’s a good thing states [won’t be able to regulate anything about AI development](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/22/senate-parliamentarian-greenlights-state-ai-law-freeze-in-gop-megabill-00416499) soon. That’ll settle the argument once and for all.~~ (Holy shit something good happened for once.)
