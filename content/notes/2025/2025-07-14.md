Every town in America should do gas-powered lawn appliance buyback programs. Drop off your fossil-fueled lawn mower, weed wacker, or leaf blower for destruction and I'll give you $100 off an electric version. If I can't outlaw excessive lawn maintenance – and I would if I could – I can dream of everyone in suburbia doing their compulsive, masturbatory ritual as quietly as possible.
