Last night I watched Pentex Productions' fan edit of the last Mission Impossible movie, ["The Final Editing"](https://editsbypentex.com/mission-impossibe-the-final-editing), and it is a marked improvement over the original, and almost makes it a good movie.

Pentex [humbly credits](https://youtu.be/bK0BDOjXBrM) the original editor and highlights their impossible tasks, but his hard work makes it all the more obvious that MI:TFR became a monument to Tom Cruise above all. Cutting out those slavish, messianic notes throughout makes the whole movie more human, though not by enough! It's still too dour and preposterous – the dialog goes in circles about what the “Entity” WANTS you to think – but a skosh over two hours is a hell of a lot better than three.
