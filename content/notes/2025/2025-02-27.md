Not only do we not have many caf√©s near us, none of them attempt to be quiet, chill spaces. When did we decide that pop music should be blasting at the local roaster? This seems like a solved design problem: set your music to or around [60 decibels](https://www.ncoa.org/adviser/hearing-aids/decibel-levels/) and pick some formless smooth jazz or heck, tune into the lo-fi girl stream and be done with it. You can charge me whatever you want for a good latte if the space isn't hostile.
