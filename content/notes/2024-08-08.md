At the end of July we went on a roadtrip down to [Assateague Island National Seashore](https://www.nps.gov/asis/index.htm) to camp on the beach with the mustangs – it was wonderful, minus the roadtrip part. Because we live in New England, to get anywhere of interest outside of it you have to slog through the [Northeast Megalopolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_megalopolis).

Connecticut is uninspiring and cramped; any route through New York City triggers insanity and a $17 toll over the George Washington bridge or an arduous, cautious, circumnavigation; New Jersey is nothing but oil refineries and warehouses. I had no idea that Delaware was going to be the most depressing of them all, but it was – route 113 is a stoplight highway fenced in by corn fields and places to trade your car deed for cash. It sucks.

You don't need to equivocate and say that North America is filled with natural delights, we know that; instead I'll further my theory that Americans' obsession with taking up space and maximizing opportunity is what [ruins much of it](https://x.com/OfficialMitchll/status/1382709940352135175?lang=en). Every square mile must have commercial space or what, people will move through space and time unaccosted? To be *that guy*, when we drove through Scotland the world was charmingly empty until, and only until, you reached a town's limits and then there would be a self-conscious sprinkling of commercial zoning, but it was concentrated in gorgeous village centers with municipal parking. It was beautiful, I think about it every day, and I couldn't stop thinking about it on my first proper roadtrip in America.
