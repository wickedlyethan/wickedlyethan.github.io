I deleted my Reddit account a few months ago now, but I can't stop going on Reddit. I check r/all like a fool, and I check r/popular like a sheep; what's missing from both is most of the good stuff on Reddit, meaning the smaller communities you joined for in the first place. So I'm glad I learned about the beautifully basic functionality of a multireddit â€“ it's just a long URL with the subs you want, such as "reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards+comics+headphones", etc. Make a bookmark and you're done, you have your own slice of Reddit. Will this feature probably get killed due to newly found obligations to shareholders? [Probably](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reddits-sky-high-ipo-too-140001254.html)! Until then, it's a brilliant hack to enjoy life with more control over the algorithms.
