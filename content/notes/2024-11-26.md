I'm enjoying Green Day's latest album, *Saviors*, well enough, but there's something missing compared to the Bush-era *American Idiot* and I couldn't help but put the two first tracks next to one another.

"The American Dream is Killing Me" has a shout-able chorus and inherits the theatrical elements from *Revolution Radio* (2016), but the lyrics are lacking something:

> Don't want no huddled masses\
TikTok and taxes\
Under the overpass\
Sleepin' in broken glass

Meanwhile:

> Well maybe I'm the faggot, America\
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda\
Now everybody do the propaganda\
And sing along to the age of paranoia

There's a lot more *there*, isn't there? The newer album feels tired in comparison. It's only been *20 years*, could it be that the rockstars of my teenage years have been ground down by two decades of everything getting demonstrably worse? How much easier was it to be truly outraged about a war in the Middle East – one that actually included American soldiers – then something as banal as the constant violation of "democratic norms"? The target was a lot bigger, and it was on TV every day. Now we have to *explain* what we're mad about and it's slippery, not incendiary.
