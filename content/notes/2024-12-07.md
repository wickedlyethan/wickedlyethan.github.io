Bad titles are my pet peeve. Video games have [always](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts_HD_2.8_Final_Chapter_Prologue) [had](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_of_War:_Assault_Squad) [tons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilty_Gear_X2_updated_versions) [of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor:_ReFantazio) [them](https://www.ubisoft.com/xdefiant-our-message-to-players), popular book genres have been in a rut of "The Blank of Blank and Blank", and one of my favorite movies of the year is titled ["My Old Ass"](https://letterboxd.com/film/my-old-ass/) and it only just barely makes sense.

My favorite source of good/bad title whiplash is *Gundam* anime. Completely separate from the quality of the actual series, titles like *The 08th MS Team*, *Iron-Blooded Orphans*, and *The Witch from Mercury* are absolutely incredible. Meanwhile *G Gundam*, *SEED Destiny*, and – seriously this is real and the most recent – *Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX* fill me with anguish. That's all, just wanted to let you know that's a real thing that got titled that way because everyone working on it is [absolutely bananapants](https://youtu.be/LnMIaFV4q6M?feature=shared).
