In wrapping up a search for a co-working space I've come to the conclusion that nothing beats your local library. It's definitionally quiet, it's cozier (you're literally surrounded by books), they are frequently delightful architectural experiences (hello, the Boston Public Library?!), and they are FREE. The only co-working space nearby is a couple of drop-ceiling rooms full of Homegoods-clearance furniture and Rae Dunn-adjacent posters; one gets the feeling its clientele might lean very MLM-and-crystals. For $200 a month you get a table without an outlet and no sense of civic pride; I'll stick to one of multiple literature cathedrals I'm blessed to have nearby.
