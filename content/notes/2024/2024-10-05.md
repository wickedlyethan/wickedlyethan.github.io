We're starting spooky season strong in this apartment. We watched Guillermo del Toro's [*Crimson Peak*](https://letterboxd.com/film/crimson-peak/) (2015) for the first time in years last night and I fell in love again with its mix of gothic horror, delicious camp, and insane craftsmanship – every frame is full of detail and the camera gracefully glides around to show it all. As a bonus, I found it damn chilling! The ghosts are great, the ratcheting of dread marvelously done, and the violence in keeping with del Toro's other work, meaning shocking and matter-of-fact.

Then this morning I caught up on this crazy story: A naval historian watched AMC's [*The Terror*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2708480/) (2015) and obsessively researched Captain James Fitzjames, finding a descendant who could provide what bioarchaeologists needed to perform DNA analysis on [recovered teeth and mandibles](https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/09/scientists-id-cannibalized-remains-of-doomed-franklin-expedition-member/) to prove that the captain was the first to be cannibalized by his fellow crew members.

> “This shows that he predeceased at least some of the other sailors who perished, and that neither rank nor status was the governing principle in the final desperate days of the expedition as they strove to save themselves,” said co-author Douglas Stenton, an anthropologist at the University of Waterloo.

I have a hard enough time watching Tobias Menzies in anything after his turn as Jack Randall in *Outlander*, but now our impending rewatch of the criminally under-discovered Arctic horror series will have a new dimension to it. 

Emily put up skull string lights, the pumpkins are out, and every morning is misty. *'Tis the season.* 🎃
