[Perfect Days (2023)](https://letterboxd.com/film/perfect-days-2023/) is an instant favorite for me and I'm glad I got to see it a cinema over the weekend. The appreciation of beautiful, simple things â€“especially nature, even in a megalopolis; the thoughtful and considerate design of Tokyo's public restrooms and other communal resources; the minimalist, utilitarian fashion; the warmth and tactile nature of physical media; remembering that every day can be a perfect day, if you think about it the right way.
