Back in college I took a class on cult films, and a culminating assignment involved seeing _Rocky Horror Picture Show_ at Chicago's beautiful and historic Music Box Theater right before Halloween. It was a bonkers affair, and having never seen the movie and being painfully introverted I was uncomfortable and baffled. It wasn't my correct cult, I think.

This past weekend I had the absolute pleasure of seeing [_Hackers_ (1995)](https://letterboxd.com/film/hackers/) at the Somerville Theater, with a full house, on a scratchy, decaying 35mm print that elevated and cheapened the film in the most delightful ways. Every campy line and silly moment was chased by huge cheers and applause. I've only ever seen _Hackers_ in my living room by myself, thinking about how much I wanted to share my love of this movie. I finally got to and it was special.
