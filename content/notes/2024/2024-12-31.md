I'm calling it, I'm done with years as a concept. I'm going full medieval peasant and following the seasons. It turns out celebrating the "new year" in the dreadful middle of winter is a [epochally recent, pope-dictated](https://www.britannica.com/story/why-does-the-new-year-start-on-january-1) *faux pas* â€“ we could be celebrating New Year's Day in March, around the spring equinox! This feels like the whole "Sunday is the first day of the week" debacle, meaning really dumb and should have been fixed a long time ago. Listen, if we can't have [thirteen 28-day months](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Fixed_Calendar), can we have the [Holocene calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_calendar) as a treat?
