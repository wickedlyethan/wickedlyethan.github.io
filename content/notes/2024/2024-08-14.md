Do macOS users not own music? For a platform elevated into the public consciousness by the freaking iPod, there is a shocking dearth of decent music players, never mind something to meaningfully manage your library with! Apple Music *n√©e* iTunes is a joke; Vox is a subscription service with oodles of unnecessary features and doesn't know what a library is; Swinsian hasn't been updated since 2021, and simply broke for me when I changed my NAS' IP. Video players like Elmedia and VLC don't count. No, I'm not paying for Roon.

My transition to mostly-mac user has been *mostly* seamless, and has come with lots of upgrades, but this ain't one 'em. Over on Windows I migrated from a decade-plus of [foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/) + [Mp3Tag](https://www.mp3tag.de/en/) to [MusicBee](https://www.getmusicbee.com/), which was a better all-in-one experience. Now I'm stranded, logging in to Windows whenever I get new music to incorporate into my library. Thank goodness at least I was introduced to [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/), a web app running off my modest homelab that can comfortably serve up my music to any device on the network, but it's read-only. I don't want another web app in my life, but at least it's *my* web app, and seems like the only good option for now.
