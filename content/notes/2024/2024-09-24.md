Listening to news about AI is making me think I'm going crazy. 

OpenAI has put out a new model it claims is capable of "reasoning" and rated it a ["medium" risk](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/371827/openai-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence-ai-risk-strawberry); Goldman Sachs "estimates that data center power demand will grow [160% by 2030](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/AI-poised-to-drive-160-increase-in-power-demand)", and will ravage our power grids. 

In 2003, Nick Bostrom proposed the ["paperclip maximizer"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence#Paperclip_maximizer) thought experiment, in which a superintelligent AI given the task of making paperclips will eventually destroy the world and all human life by trying to turn everything into paperclips or things that make paperclips. 

In 1967, Harlan Ellison published the short story "I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream", in which a superintelligent AI designed to win the Cold War decides it's better to kill all humans except for five and raze the surface of the Earth into a hellscape that harvests materials and power to run itself.

In 1979's *Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*, the best supercomputer in the universe was given the ultimate prompt and gave the stupidest answer. In response, the ancient aliens who built it built an even more massive, powerful supercomputer to answer the Ultimate Question – Earth, which gets blown up in the first pages.

In 2013, the movie *Her* proposes a future in which we are so lonely we [buy AI companions](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/may/27/scarlett-johansson-openai-legal-artificial-intelligence-chatgpt) and fall in love with them, while protagonist Theodore is reduced to a machine who [writes letters for people](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/30/nx-s1-5056201/google-olympics-ai-ad).

In his [2014 book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20527133-superintelligence), Bostrom uses parables and data to strongly warn that diving into "AI" and figuring it out later is not sustainable or safe. He more succinctly says “some little idiot is bound to press the ignite button just to see what happens".

I think that there's a race going on to be the first fucking idiot, using multiple pieces of great culture not as warnings but as the instructions on how to build it, with sycophants and VCs filling in all the blanks in their lack of imagination.
