After seeing and very much enjoying [*Furiosa*](https://letterboxd.com/film/furiosa-a-mad-max-saga/), I couldn't help but notice a "if I had a nickel for each time" trend for trailers: lines that sound better in the trailer, cut specifically for that rhythm and tone, than in the finished movie. [Here](https://youtu.be/FVswuip0-co?si=cfrii-w2Hi-H2FEN) it is Dementus' "Where are you going, so full of hope? There is no hope!"

Before that, in the original [*Oppenheimer* trailer](https://youtu.be/bK6ldnjE3Y0?si=-eMoAMDg2wHklB5_) it was... well it was every line pretty much, but especially "they won't understand it, until they've used it", which is mixed in such a radically different way from the film that it feels bizarre to look at, but delivers more of a punch in the trailer.

My wife avoids trailers at all costs; I embrace them as their own wonderful cinematic art form and giddily await them before every showing I go to, but I'll keep this in mind every time now!
