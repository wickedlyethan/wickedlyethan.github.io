I've been trying to keep my phone away from the bed for years, but I've been blocked by the dumbest, should-be-simplest functionality: alarms. Standard alarm clocks are totally inflexible; my Fitbit has a Smart Wake functionality, but it's centered around the time you set for the alarm. Only the horribly named, very Android-core [Sleep as Android](https://sleep.urbandroid.org/) has what I would consider the *correct* way to do things: You tell the app when you're going to sleep and it sets an alarm, monitors your sleep state, then gently wakes you within a 30 minute window of the alarm. The problem? You have to keep your phone next to you, under your pillow, all night long. Everyone else is doing it wrong and it's driving me batty.
