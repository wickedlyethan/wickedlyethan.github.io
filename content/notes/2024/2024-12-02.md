*Gladiator 2* was a solidly good time, and it's Denzel Washington's movie for sure; he wears ten rings and glides around in golden capes as he convincingly takes the republic from within by sheer guile. 

Multiple times the "dream of Rome" from the first film is mentioned, almost religiously, as an ideal that must be resurrected, protected, and spread to the people. A sacred dream of Rome without imperial rule, one might even say a Rome with the "consent of the governed". 

Washington's Macrinus has no belief in that dream, and explains that the Colosseum is the "greatest temple Rome ever built" – all he, and he is convinced everyone else, believes in is power. Mescal's Lucius protests naively – "there must be another Rome". Marcinus replies, forcefully, willing it to be: "There is no other Rome."

In other words a rich businessman uses sheer force of will and money to con his way into tyrannical rule, brazenly ignoring rules and norms because he believes with absolute certainty that the natural state of people – and the State – is to worship the application of power.

Sound familiar?
