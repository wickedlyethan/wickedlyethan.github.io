Learning more about the [death of *VICE*](https://www.theverge.com/24094310/vice-media-layoffs-bankruptcy-shane-smith) baffles and angers me in turn. One never got the impression they were a well-run company – a nonsensical TV strategy  threw a lot of their judgement into question – but finding out that the whole enterprise was Shane Smith's piggy bank sucks. Like *Buzzfeed* and its sister publication *Buzzfeed News*, *VICE News* was an award-winning, influential, and [fearless](https://peabodyawards.com/award-profile/the-islamic-state/) group of journalists doing important work paid for by cringe shitposting. That model worked for a long time, but both organizations fucked themselves – and got fucked by platforms – and now they're gone. Pulitzers, Peabodys, and Emmys couldn't save them in the face of capitalist shitheels, and the news landscape is worse for it.
