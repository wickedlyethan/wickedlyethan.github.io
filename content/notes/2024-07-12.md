summary: "I will forever bang the drum that the *Planet Earth* series is the most important thing ever filmed. I think they should be taught in schools; I think we should huddle around the TV and watch them like the Apollo landings. Someday the world won't look like this any more, and these will be the best record we have of it."

I will forever bang the drum that the *Planet Earth* series is the most important thing ever filmed. I think it should be taught they schools; I think we should huddle around the TV and watch them like the Apollo landings. Someday the world won't look like this any more, and these will be the best record we have of it.

The third series came out in 2023 and arrived recently on 4K blu-ray – watching an episode is meditative, frightening, othering, and stunning. These are best-in-class discs for any A/V nerd, and the images and sequences are mind-boggling in their clarity and complexity.

So yes, it's a sight to behold and a delight for the senses, but Attenborough and team aren't letting us gawk without reproach – segments about fishing bycatch, desertification, coral bleaching, and other byproducts of the anthropocene are clear about where fault lies. This isn't the usual turning of the world.

Luckily the BBC Earth team isn't as dour as I'm being – there's comedy to be found in a lazing leopard or the absurdity of angel sharks, and joy in a desert flourishing into grasslands. Every second is worth watching to hold onto that.
