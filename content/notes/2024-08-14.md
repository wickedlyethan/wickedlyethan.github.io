Do macOS users not own music? For a platform elevated into the public consciousness by the freaking iPod, there is a shocking dearth of decent music players, never mind something to meaningfully manage your library with! iTunes is a joke and stubbornly doesn't support FLAC; Vox is a subscription service with oodles of unnecessary features and lackluster library access; [Swinsian](https://swinsian.com/) hasn't been updated since 2021, and simply broke for me when I changed my NAS' IP. Video players like Elmedia and VLC don't count.

My transition to mostly-mac user has been mostly seamless, and has come with lots of upgrades, but this ain't one 'em â€“ it would appear that the most ghastly user behavior would be to play high-quality music from a NAS and maintain that library over time. Over on Windows I migrated from a decade-plus of [foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/) to [MusicBee](https://www.getmusicbee.com/), which was a better all-in-one experience. Now I'm stranded, logging in to Windows whenever I get new music to incorporate into my library; thank goodness I was introduced to [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/), a web app running off my modest homelab that can comfortably access my NAS and serve up my music on any device on the network. I don't want another web app in my life, but at least it's *my* web app.
