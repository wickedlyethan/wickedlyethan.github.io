The early 2000s were a magnificent time for sci-fi movies in general, but shout-out to Christian Bale for headlining some of the most out-there genre faire of the time.

- I have a real fondness for [_Reign of Fire_ (2002)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0253556) and think that movie is totally underrated
- [_Equilibrium_ (2002)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238380/) is one of the most bonkers dystopia-for-beginners movies ever, with a clear proto-_John Wick_ vibe in hindsight with its death ballet
- I don't need to explain to you that [_The Prestige_ (2006)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482571/) is one of the greatest movies ever
- I need to give [_Terminator Salvation_ (2009)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482571/) a real watch now that I know there's a director's cut and we're far away enough from its complete nothingburger of a controversy,
- Oh and there were those little Batman movies, those were pretty cool and I heard they did ok. /s
