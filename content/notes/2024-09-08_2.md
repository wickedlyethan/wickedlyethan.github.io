Downsizing is hard! After months of ruthlessly getting rid of lots of disparate objects around the apartment, today I finally got rid of a beloved childhood bean bag chair and of all things to get emotional about it was that. For years it was set up in my small childhood room between a misplaced contemporary bookshelf and the door. I used a clip–on task light to read late into the night; I used to watch DVDs from Blockbuster and Netflix on a 7” personal dvd player; I had my own landline telephone with caller ID and I’d talk with friends for hours there. It was the centerpiece of my first curated, designed, safe space and from there it traveled to my first dorm, my first apartment, my first rented house, and to this first apartment with my now-wife. When Arlo was a kitten he would launch himself onto it or curl up in its canvas concave for hours; he and I got to know each other as he played in my lap in front of the TV. 

All this to say that it was time to say goodbye – it’s been in storage for 4 years – and because it’s a high quality piece I brought it to the local swap shed, where hopefully it can give someone else some core memories, but that doesn’t mean I didn’t feel a lot of things as we pulled away. It’s rare that childhood and family can be concretely manifested by an object, but you can keep the memories even if you get rid of the thing.
