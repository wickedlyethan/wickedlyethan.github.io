<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Ethan and I&rsquo;m a technical writer in biotechnology in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>I love books and movies, have a love-hate relationship with games, play drums, and am getting back into photography. I try to be thoughtful about media and tech - the things I love I really love and the stuff I hate I try to understand, at least.</p>
<p>I have a lot of stories I want to tell and am constantly struggling to carve out the time in life to write them, so I call myself a &ldquo;writer&rdquo; aspirationally for now!</p>
<p>I have a deeply adversarial relationship with platforms and social media, so part of my perennial tinkering with this site is to work that out. I want to post more and own it all.</p>
