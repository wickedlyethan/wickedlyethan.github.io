<p><code>Last Updated: 2024-05-17</code></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started my new technical writing job and have been thrown into the deep end of very corporate, big-scale software development. It&rsquo;s a strange, arcane world but I&rsquo;m getting a grasp on it quickly enough, and I&rsquo;m good enough at what I do that I have no problems actually doing my job.</p>
<p>My <strong>forever project</strong> is downsizing our apartment and getting rid of stuff – we&rsquo;re in the phase of our life where we&rsquo;re shucking away all the hand-me-downs and stuff we combined when we moved together in college. It&rsquo;s really hard sometimes, but it&rsquo;s all in service of having less anxiety about how much we have and how hard it would be to move.</p>
