    <h2><a href="/blog/2024/04/retro-games-are-great-but-not-sacred/">Retro Games are Great, but Not Sacred</a></h2><p class="post-data">2024-04-27 // 515 words // 3 minute read</p>A great thing about retro games is that it&rsquo;s always the new best time to play them: cheap emulator handhelds are plentiful and constantly getting better; Apple finally allowed emulators onto the app store due to regulatory pressure and Delta is by all reports an incredible option; and FPGA chips are getting more common, so the quality of emulation on certain hardware is near-perfect. You can play old games on any hardware, any time.

    <p>Learning more about the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24094310/vice-media-layoffs-bankruptcy-shane-smith">death of <em>VICE</em></a> baffles and angers me in turn. One never got the impression they were a well-run company – a nonsensical TV strategy  threw a lot of their judgement into question – but finding out that the whole enterprise was Shane Smith&rsquo;s piggy bank sucks. Like <em>Buzzfeed</em> and its sister publication <em>Buzzfeed News</em>, <em>VICE News</em> was an award-winning, influential, and <a href="https://peabodyawards.com/award-profile/the-islamic-state/">fearless</a> group of journalists doing important work paid for by cringe shitposting. That model worked for a long time, but both organizations fucked themselves – and got fucked by platforms – and now they&rsquo;re gone. Pulitzers, Peabodys, and Emmys couldn&rsquo;t save them in the face of capitalist shitheels, and the news landscape is worse for it.</p>

The other good news about pinball is that it&rsquo;s everywhere – pinball appears to have had a resurgence during the pandemic, like many vintage forms of gaming, and shows like Pintastic will only get bigger.

I&rsquo;ve had a personal website since middle school in one form or another - Blogger, Wordpress, Tumblr, then in college hand-crafted, deeply amateur HTML. We&rsquo;re way past the ship of Theseus at this point, past sports car getting rebuilt in the garage; it&rsquo;s some kind of mania.

    <p>I know Marvel Discourse is considered indescribably lame, but I&rsquo;m watching <em>Captain America: Civil War</em> (2016) because I got it on 4k for very little, and there&rsquo;s a lot to say about these early Russo brothers films! The techno-thriller vibes, the nasty and up-close fight and stunt choreography, the centering of two deeply flawed men as the protagonists/id/ego of all superheroes in general. It&rsquo;s both really damn good and already so Of Its Time already (oh gods it&rsquo;s almost ten years old ugh). A fun fact and perhaps an early barometer of how this flavor was getting stale even at the time: <em>Finding Dory</em> made $26 million more in the box office and became the highest grossing movie of the year instead.</p>

    <p>Similar to making your phone grayscale, stripping out the colors and fluff from important interfaces can be a great way to figure out what you really need and expose the bullshit for what it is. Enter <a href="http://68k.news/">68k.news: Headlines From the Future</a>, one of my favorite low-tech websites. It&rsquo;s literally Google News but stripped of all its styling and images, for good and bad: every news item still gets multiple sources, but those sources are frequently corporate dogshit. Still, it&rsquo;s better than visiting those sites directly and it can help fight the echo chamber a little bit, all while not destroying your browsing experience with many-megabyte pages filled with ads, videos, and flashy elements that distract you from trying to understand anything that&rsquo;s going on.</p>

    <p>I deleted my Reddit account a few months ago now, but I can&rsquo;t stop going on Reddit. I check r/all like a fool, and I check r/popular like a sheep; what&rsquo;s missing from both is most of the good stuff on Reddit, meaning the smaller communities you joined for in the first place. So I&rsquo;m glad I learned about the beautifully basic functionality of a multireddit – it&rsquo;s just a long URL with the subs you want, such as &ldquo;reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards+comics+headphones&rdquo;, etc. Make a bookmark and you&rsquo;re done, you have your own slice of Reddit. Will this feature probably get killed due to newly found obligations to shareholders? <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reddits-sky-high-ipo-too-140001254.html">Probably</a>! Until then, it&rsquo;s a brilliant hack to enjoy life with more control over the algorithms.</p>

    <p><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/perfect-days-2023/">Perfect Days (2023)</a> is an instant favorite for me and I&rsquo;m glad I got to see it a cinema over the weekend. The appreciation of beautiful, simple things –especially nature, even in a megalopolis; the thoughtful and considerate design of Tokyo&rsquo;s public restrooms and other communal resources; the minimalist, utilitarian fashion; the warmth and tactile nature of physical media; remembering that every day can be a perfect day, if you think about it the right way.</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/2024/03/dopamine-was-never-enough/">Dopamine Was Never Enough</a></h2><p class="post-data">2024-03-28 // 1116 words // 6 minute read</p>In the latest issue of The Convival Society, L.M. Sacasas responds to Ted Gioia&rsquo;s essay &ldquo;The State of the Culture, 2024&rdquo;, and they both have interesting thoughts on distraction and technology use. I like both and also disagree with them, and I wanted to get some thoughts down.
Let&rsquo;s take a look at the source essay first. Gioia, in his frank style, makes the argument that distraction is subsuming all other forms of culture, and that the peddlers of said distraction are a &ldquo;dopamine cartel&rdquo;, solely focused on creating users who are addicted to the low-quality content on their platforms.

    <p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to keep my phone away from the bed for years, but I&rsquo;ve been blocked by the dumbest, should-be-simplest functionality: alarms. Standard alarm clocks are totally inflexible; my Fitbit has a Smart Wake functionality, but it&rsquo;s centered around the time you set for the alarm. Only the horribly named, very Android-core <a href="https://sleep.urbandroid.org/">Sleep as Android</a> has what I would consider the <em>correct</em> way to do things: You tell the app when you&rsquo;re going to sleep and it sets an alarm, monitors your sleep state, then gently wakes you within a 30 minute window of the alarm. The problem? You have to keep your phone next to you, under your pillow, all night long. Everyone else is doing it wrong and it&rsquo;s driving me batty.</p>
