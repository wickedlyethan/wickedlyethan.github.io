    <p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to keep my phone away from the bed for years, but I&rsquo;ve been blocked by the dumbest, should-be-simplest functionality: alarms. Standard alarm clocks are totally inflexible; my Fitbit has a Smart Wake functionality, but it&rsquo;s centered around the time you set for the alarm. Only the horribly named, very Android-core <a href="https://sleep.urbandroid.org/">Sleep as Android</a> has what I would consider the <em>correct</em> way to do things: You tell the app when you&rsquo;re going to sleep and it sets an alarm, monitors your sleep state, then gently wakes you within a 30 minute window of the alarm. The problem? You have to keep your phone next to you, under your pillow, all night long. Everyone else is doing it wrong and it&rsquo;s driving me batty.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;ll probably write a proper post about this at some point, but in &ldquo;launching&rdquo; yet another new design for my site (hopefully this one will stick, I actually built it for content, now I just need to make content!) I looked at tons of inspiration. Here&rsquo;s some of it: the <a href="https://buttondown.email/ownyourweb/archive/">Own Your Website newsletter</a> by Matthias Ott, <a href="https://deadsimplesites.com/">Dead Simple Sites</a> by Arcade Labs, <a href="https://jamesg.blog/2024/02/19/personal-website-ideas/">&ldquo;100 things you can do on your personal website&rdquo;</a> by James Coffee, and of course my dear friend <a href="https://nathanwentworth.co/">nathan wentworth&rsquo;s</a> personal site. The breakthrough came, however, from remembering the perfection that is <a href="https://www.indexhibit.org/">Indexhibit</a>, which I obviously took tons of inspiration from.</p>

    The average person listens to between two and four hours of music a day. Then there&rsquo;s podcasts and audiobooks, YouTube videos, phone calls - we listen to so much stuff all the time, yet most people simply don&rsquo;t care about how they listen to stuff and that makes me sad.
Wired earbuds returned for a moment in 2021 so TikTok makers could whisper dramatically into the in-line microphone, but this one random report points to the &ldquo;true wireless stereo earbuds market&rdquo; reaching $243.

    The first red flag was Henry Cavill&rsquo;s haircut in the trailer. The second red flag, also from the trailer, was the obnoxious title card &ldquo;FROM THE TWISTED MIND OF MATTHEW VAUGN&rdquo;. The third red flag was this BBC One interview where the venerable Ali Plumb tries his best to find anything to talk about but can&rsquo;t because of all supposed twists and turns of this &ldquo;meta&rdquo; spy adventure.
That video is what made me want to spend a Bargain Tuesday seeing it, ironically, because surely this cast is so charming, that&rsquo;ll be enough, right?
