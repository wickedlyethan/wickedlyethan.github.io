    <p>I&rsquo;ll probably write a proper post about this at some point, but in &ldquo;launching&rdquo; yet another new design for my site (hopefully this one will stick, I actually built it for content, now I just need to make content!) I looked at tons of inspiration. Here&rsquo;s some of it: the <a href="https://buttondown.email/ownyourweb/archive/">Own Your Website newsletter</a> by Matthias Ott, <a href="https://deadsimplesites.com/">Dead Simple Sites</a> by Arcade Labs, <a href="https://jamesg.blog/2024/02/19/personal-website-ideas/">&ldquo;100 things you can do on your personal website&rdquo;</a> by James Coffee, and of course my dear friend <a href="https://nathanwentworth.co/">nathan wentworth&rsquo;s</a> personal site. The breakthrough came, however, from remembering the perfection that is <a href="https://www.indexhibit.org/">Indexhibit</a>, which I obviously took tons of inspiration from.</p>

    The average person listens to between two and four hours of music a day. Then there&rsquo;s podcasts and audiobooks, YouTube videos, phone calls - we listen to so much stuff all the time, yet most people simply don&rsquo;t care about how they listen to stuff and that makes me sad.
Wired earbuds returned for a moment in 2021 so TikTok makers could whisper dramatically into the in-line microphone, but this one random report points to the &ldquo;true wireless stereo earbuds market&rdquo; reaching $243.

    The first red flag was Henry Cavill&rsquo;s haircut in the trailer. The second red flag, also from the trailer, was the obnoxious title card &ldquo;FROM THE TWISTED MIND OF MATTHEW VAUGN&rdquo;. The third red flag was this BBC One interview where the venerable Ali Plumb tries his best to find anything to talk about but can&rsquo;t because of all supposed twists and turns of this &ldquo;meta&rdquo; spy adventure.
That video is what made me want to spend a Bargain Tuesday seeing it, ironically, because surely this cast is so charming, that&rsquo;ll be enough, right?

    Books Prayer for the Crown-Shy by Becky Chambers I was trying to be good and write about books that came out this year - striving to be contemporary, for once - but I have to, and must, talk about this book.
I&rsquo;m deeply jealous at how amazing a writer Becky Chambers is, but the truth is it is a privilege to get to read books this good. Every work of hers I&rsquo;ve read - To be Taught, if Fortunate, A Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet, and A Psalm for the Wild-Built - have instantly become not only favorites of mine, but texts to turn to in bad times.
