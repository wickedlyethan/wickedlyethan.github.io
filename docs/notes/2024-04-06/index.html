<h1>2024-04-06</h1>

<p>I know Marvel Discourse is considered indescribably lame, but I&rsquo;m watching <em>Captain America: Civil War</em> (2016) because I got it on 4k for very little, and there&rsquo;s a lot to say about these early Russo brothers films! The techno-thriller vibes, the nasty and up-close fight and stunt choreography, the centering of two deeply flawed men as the protagonists/id/ego of all superheroes in general. It&rsquo;s both really damn good and already so Of Its Time already (oh gods it&rsquo;s almost ten years old ugh). A fun fact and perhaps an early barometer of how this flavor was getting stale even at the time: <em>Finding Dory</em> made $26 million more in the box office and became the highest grossing movie of the year instead.</p>
