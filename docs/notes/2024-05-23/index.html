<h1>2024-05-23</h1>

<p>After seeing and very much enjoying <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/furiosa-a-mad-max-saga/"><em>Furiosa</em></a>, I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice a &ldquo;if I had a nickel for each time&rdquo; trend for trailers: lines that sound better in the trailer, cut specifically for that rhythm and tone, than in the finished movie. <a href="https://youtu.be/FVswuip0-co?si=cfrii-w2Hi-H2FEN">Here</a> it is Dementus&rsquo; &ldquo;Where are you going, so full of hope? There is no hope!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before that, in the original <a href="https://youtu.be/bK6ldnjE3Y0?si=-eMoAMDg2wHklB5_"><em>Oppenheimer</em> trailer</a> it was&hellip; well it was every line pretty much, but especially &ldquo;they won&rsquo;t understand it, until they&rsquo;ve used it&rdquo;, which is mixed in such a radically different way from the film that it feels bizarre to look at, but delivers more of a punch in the trailer.</p>
<p>My wife avoids trailers at all costs; I embrace them as their own wonderful cinematic art form and giddily await them before every showing I go to, but I&rsquo;ll keep this in mind every time now!</p>
