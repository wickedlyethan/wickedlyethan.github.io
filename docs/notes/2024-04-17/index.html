<p>Learning more about the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24094310/vice-media-layoffs-bankruptcy-shane-smith">death of <em>VICE</em></a> baffles and angers me in turn. One never got the impression they were a well-run company – a nonsensical TV strategy  threw a lot of their judgement into question – but finding out that the whole enterprise was Shane Smith&rsquo;s piggy bank sucks. Like <em>Buzzfeed</em> and its sister publication <em>Buzzfeed News</em>, <em>VICE News</em> was an award-winning, influential, and <a href="https://peabodyawards.com/award-profile/the-islamic-state/">fearless</a> group of journalists doing important work paid for by cringe shitposting. That model worked for a long time, but both organizations fucked themselves – and got fucked by platforms – and now they&rsquo;re gone. Pulitzers, Peabodys, and Emmys couldn&rsquo;t save them in the face of capitalist shitheels, and the news landscape is worse for it.</p>
