<h1>2024-04-01_2</h1>

<p>I deleted my Reddit account a few months ago now, but I can&rsquo;t stop going on Reddit. I check r/all like a fool, and I check r/popular like a sheep; what&rsquo;s missing from both is most of the good stuff on Reddit, meaning the smaller communities you joined for in the first place. So I&rsquo;m glad I learned about the beautifully basic functionality of a multireddit – it&rsquo;s just a long URL with the subs you want, such as &ldquo;reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards+comics+headphones&rdquo;, etc. Make a bookmark and you&rsquo;re done, you have your own slice of Reddit. Will this feature probably get killed due to newly found obligations to shareholders? <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reddits-sky-high-ipo-too-140001254.html">Probably</a>! Until then, it&rsquo;s a brilliant hack to enjoy life with more control over the algorithms.</p>
