        <p>Learning more about the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24094310/vice-media-layoffs-bankruptcy-shane-smith">death of <em>VICE</em></a> baffles and angers me in turn. One never got the impression they were a well-run company – a nonsensical TV strategy  threw a lot of their judgement into question – but finding out that the whole enterprise was Shane Smith&rsquo;s piggy bank sucks. Like <em>Buzzfeed</em> and its sister publication <em>Buzzfeed News</em>, <em>VICE News</em> was an award-winning, influential, and <a href="https://peabodyawards.com/award-profile/the-islamic-state/">fearless</a> group of journalists doing important work paid for by cringe shitposting. That model worked for a long time, but both organizations fucked themselves – and got fucked by platforms – and now they&rsquo;re gone. Pulitzers, Peabodys, and Emmys couldn&rsquo;t save them in the face of capitalist shitheels, and the news landscape is worse for it.</p>

        <p>I know Marvel Discourse is considered indescribably lame, but I&rsquo;m watching <em>Captain America: Civil War</em> (2016) because I got it on 4k for very little, and there&rsquo;s a lot to say about these early Russo brothers films! The techno-thriller vibes, the nasty and up-close fight and stunt choreography, the centering of two deeply flawed men as the protagonists/id/ego of all superheroes in general. It&rsquo;s both really damn good and already so Of Its Time already (oh gods it&rsquo;s almost ten years old ugh). A fun fact and perhaps an early barometer of how this flavor was getting stale even at the time: <em>Finding Dory</em> made $26 million more in the box office and became the highest grossing movie of the year instead.</p>

        <p>Similar to making your phone grayscale, stripping out the colors and fluff from important interfaces can be a great way to figure out what you really need and expose the bullshit for what it is. Enter <a href="http://68k.news/">68k.news: Headlines From the Future</a>, one of my favorite low-tech websites. It&rsquo;s literally Google News but stripped of all its styling and images, for good and bad: every news item still gets multiple sources, but those sources are frequently corporate dogshit. Still, it&rsquo;s better than visiting those sites directly and it can help fight the echo chamber a little bit, all while not destroying your browsing experience with many-megabyte pages filled with ads, videos, and flashy elements that distract you from trying to understand anything that&rsquo;s going on.</p>

        <p>I deleted my Reddit account a few months ago now, but I can&rsquo;t stop going on Reddit. I check r/all like a fool, and I check r/popular like a sheep; what&rsquo;s missing from both is most of the good stuff on Reddit, meaning the smaller communities you joined for in the first place. So I&rsquo;m glad I learned about the beautifully basic functionality of a multireddit – it&rsquo;s just a long URL with the subs you want, such as &ldquo;reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards+comics+headphones&rdquo;, etc. Make a bookmark and you&rsquo;re done, you have your own slice of Reddit. Will this feature probably get killed due to newly found obligations to shareholders? <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reddits-sky-high-ipo-too-140001254.html">Probably</a>! Until then, it&rsquo;s a brilliant hack to enjoy life with more control over the algorithms.</p>

        <p><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/perfect-days-2023/">Perfect Days (2023)</a> is an instant favorite for me and I&rsquo;m glad I got to see it a cinema over the weekend. The appreciation of beautiful, simple things –especially nature, even in a megalopolis; the thoughtful and considerate design of Tokyo&rsquo;s public restrooms and other communal resources; the minimalist, utilitarian fashion; the warmth and tactile nature of physical media; remembering that every day can be a perfect day, if you think about it the right way.</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to keep my phone away from the bed for years, but I&rsquo;ve been blocked by the dumbest, should-be-simplest functionality: alarms. Standard alarm clocks are totally inflexible; my Fitbit has a Smart Wake functionality, but it&rsquo;s centered around the time you set for the alarm. Only the horribly named, very Android-core <a href="https://sleep.urbandroid.org/">Sleep as Android</a> has what I would consider the <em>correct</em> way to do things: You tell the app when you&rsquo;re going to sleep and it sets an alarm, monitors your sleep state, then gently wakes you within a 30 minute window of the alarm. The problem? You have to keep your phone next to you, under your pillow, all night long. Everyone else is doing it wrong and it&rsquo;s driving me batty.</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ll probably write a proper post about this at some point, but in &ldquo;launching&rdquo; yet another new design for my site (hopefully this one will stick, I actually built it for content, now I just need to make content!) I looked at tons of inspiration. Here&rsquo;s some of it: the <a href="https://buttondown.email/ownyourweb/archive/">Own Your Website newsletter</a> by Matthias Ott, <a href="https://deadsimplesites.com/">Dead Simple Sites</a> by Arcade Labs, <a href="https://jamesg.blog/2024/02/19/personal-website-ideas/">&ldquo;100 things you can do on your personal website&rdquo;</a> by James Coffee, and of course my dear friend <a href="https://nathanwentworth.co/">nathan wentworth&rsquo;s</a> personal site. The breakthrough came, however, from remembering the perfection that is <a href="https://www.indexhibit.org/">Indexhibit</a>, which I obviously took tons of inspiration from.</p>
