        <p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to keep my phone away from the bed for years, but I&rsquo;ve been blocked by the dumbest, should-be-simplest functionality: alarms. Standard alarm clocks are totally inflexible; my Fitbit has a Smart Wake functionality, but it&rsquo;s centered around the time you set for the alarm. Only the horribly named, very Android-core <a href="https://sleep.urbandroid.org/">Sleep as Android</a> has what I would consider the <em>correct</em> way to do things: You tell the app when you&rsquo;re going to sleep and it sets an alarm, monitors your sleep state, then gently wakes you within a 30 minute window of the alarm. The problem? You have to keep your phone next to you, under your pillow, all night long. Everyone else is doing it wrong and it&rsquo;s driving me batty.</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ll probably write a proper post about this at some point, but in &ldquo;launching&rdquo; yet another new design for my site (hopefully this one will stick, I actually built it for content, now I just need to make content!) I looked at tons of inspiration. Here&rsquo;s some of it: the <a href="https://buttondown.email/ownyourweb/archive/">Own Your Website newsletter</a> by Matthias Ott, <a href="https://deadsimplesites.com/">Dead Simple Sites</a> by Arcade Labs, <a href="https://jamesg.blog/2024/02/19/personal-website-ideas/">&ldquo;100 things you can do on your personal website&rdquo;</a> by James Coffee, and of course my dear friend <a href="https://nathanwentworth.co/">nathan wentworth&rsquo;s</a> personal site. The breakthrough came, however, from remembering the perfection that is <a href="https://www.indexhibit.org/">Indexhibit</a>, which I obviously took tons of inspiration from.</p>
