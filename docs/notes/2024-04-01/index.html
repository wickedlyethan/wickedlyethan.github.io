<h1>2024-04-01</h1>

<p>Similar to making your phone grayscale, stripping out the colors and fluff from important interfaces can be a great way to figure out what you really need and expose the bullshit for what it is. Enter <a href="http://68k.news/">68k.news: Headlines From the Future</a>, one of my favorite low-tech websites. It&rsquo;s literally Google News but stripped of all its styling and images, for good and bad: every news item still gets multiple sources, but those sources are frequently corporate dogshit. Still, it&rsquo;s better than visiting those sites directly and it can help fight the echo chamber a little bit, all while not destroying your browsing experience with many-megabyte pages filled with ads, videos, and flashy elements that distract you from trying to understand anything that&rsquo;s going on.</p>
