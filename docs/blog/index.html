        </p>
        <blockquote style="font-style: normal;">I adore The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, but to pretend that it can&rsquo;t be improved is silly. I put off a replay until the &ldquo;next-gen&rdquo; patch released - complete with Icarian performance issues - but knew I wasn&rsquo;t going to go into it without some quality of life fixes and tweaks. The game is simply too massive, too big a commitment, to go through all the friction all over again. Agreeably, that friction is part of the romance of The Witcher 3 the first time around, but we&rsquo;re here to visit old friends and slip back into familiar, muddy boots, not to play the way I did the first time around: an hour or two a day for almost six months, becoming a Witcher and doing a few objectives a day like it was my job.</blockquote>

        <blockquote style="font-style: normal;">We&rsquo;re back doing one of these! A surprisingly earnest year with lots of adventure.</blockquote>

        <blockquote style="font-style: normal;">Thanksgiving as a holiday has been having a slow-motion reckoning over the years, somewhat alongside Columbus in all of his fuckery. In celebration, in a friend&rsquo;s Discord server someone casually dropped Native Land Digital, a not-for-profit that superimposes indigenous nation territories onto the world as we definitely don&rsquo;t know it today, without standard state and country borders and topographical information only.
Being from Massachusetts I&rsquo;ve always been surrounded by Indigenous American culture in the exact way that makes it sadly invisible.</blockquote>

        </p>
        <blockquote style="font-style: normal;">That&rsquo;s right, we&rsquo;re doing one of these EVERY year. Featuring: communist witches, superhero ennui, hot scots, and the answer to what part of you your cat will eat first when you die.</blockquote>

        <blockquote style="font-style: normal;">I&rsquo;ll never remember everything, and there&rsquo;s little things that I can&rsquo;t fit into these categories, but here&rsquo;s a retrospective of all the input I took in this year, all the thoughts I let invade my head to try and quiet it down a little bit, or conversely, wake up from a deep dream.</blockquote>

        </p>
        <blockquote style="font-style: normal;">My family on my dad&rsquo;s side are a bunch of nautical nerds. When Rare announced &ldquo;Sea of Thieves&rdquo; a while ago, my interest piqued immediately, and with the opportunity to jump into the &ldquo;final beta&rdquo; over the weekend I got some of what I always wanted, but also a bunch that I didn&rsquo;t.</blockquote>
