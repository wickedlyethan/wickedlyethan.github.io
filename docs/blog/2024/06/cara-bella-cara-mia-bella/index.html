<p>I want to tell you about one of the most beautiful pieces of music in the world, but it requires context:</p>
<p>One of the most wonderful but strange feelings is finding beauty in something other people don&rsquo;t, and struggling to properly convey to them how deeply it makes you feel.</p>
<p>I have this with the sound of the <a href="https://www.vintagesynth.com/casio/vl-tone-vl-1">Casio VL-1</a>, its famous &ldquo;fantasy&rdquo; preset beloved in the chiptune community. The first shot from <em>Tangled</em> (2010) that shows Rapunzel&rsquo;s tower in full can reduce me to tears pretty quickly. Being near Red Pandas at the zoo<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> churns my insides with joy. A moment of pure quiet with nothing but bird song outside the window is something I wish I could explain to someone how it makes me feel.</p>
<p>So anyways, <em>Portal 2</em> (2011) has a good soundtrack, but doesn&rsquo;t recapture the moment of <em>Portal</em>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Still Alive&rdquo; by Jonathan Coulton, which makes sense because the original game and that song were huge hits and useful artifacts to point to when talking about the seemingly unbridled creativity of games released in 2007. &ldquo;Want You Gone&rdquo; repeats the motif of murderous robot GLaDOS singing at the player over the credits – the first line is, in fact, &ldquo;Well, here we are again&rdquo;. But before that track, something weird happens.</p>
<p>Valve Software is a weird company (the more unsaid the better) and has specific sound design elements it uses in its games.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> One of those quintessential sound design elements is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_McLain">Ellen McLain</a>, who has made a career out of playing AI characters like GLaDOS but is actually a classically trained vocalist. Unfortunately those two things collided in the worst way for the track that ends <em>Portal 2</em>:</p>

<p><em>You flew too close to the sun</em>. The vocal processing butchers a probably wonderful performance, <em>not that I can tell</em>, the marching sixteenth notes clash with an inconsistent bass drum, and the jazz solo using the squeaky voices of the turrets near the end is ill-advised. I hate this track, yet there&rsquo;s something compelling here: the opening bleeps and bloops have something baroque about them, and the choice of Italian lyrics feels like a nod to McLain&rsquo;s background as well as a nod to something darkly liturgical about GLAaDOS&rsquo; final ode to science.</p>
<p>So anyways, remember a capella? Around the same time as <em>Portal 2</em>&rsquo;s release Pentatonix was taking over the world and the <em>Pitch Perfect</em> movies were a thing, never mind <em>Glee</em> which I don&rsquo;t want to talk about. (I was in theater but apart from the theater kids, which I now think of as a blessing, no offense.)</p>
<p>In the same year as <em>Portal 2</em>&rsquo;s release, an a capella group from the University of California Santa Cruz, &ldquo;Acquire A Cappella&rdquo;, self-proclaimed &ldquo;punniest a cappella group on the campus&rdquo; (which horrifyingly implies there are multiple), released a cover of &ldquo;Cara Mia Addio&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It is one of the most beautiful pieces of music in the world.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t link the original, because it was deleted from YouTube who knows when.</p>
<p>A random channel re-uploaded it in 2016, when the world needed it.</p>
<p>So here it is, one of the most beautiful pieces of music in the world. After the first 44 seconds, which too-faithfully re-create the opening to the original track, and then:</p>

      <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" loading="eager" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5MlCM0mR8DQ?autoplay=0&controls=1&end=0&loop=0&mute=0&start=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" title="YouTube video"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

<p>This is one of those things that I can&rsquo;t convey how much, how deeply it makes me feel. I&rsquo;m not sure what else I can write about it, other than that it is a deeply weird, specific media artifact that makes me want to explode into light particles and float away on the wind, or look deeply at the sky until it doesn&rsquo;t make sense any more, or get dirt under my fingernails.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably good scientific reasoning why, through sonics or sociology or something, never mind the incredible skill of all the performers involved, or it might be shallow nostalgia for a great game at a much simpler time in life, or it might be the fact that it &ldquo;has no right&rdquo; to be so beautiful given its ludicrous pedigree; it&rsquo;s own esoteric nature might be the reason it catches me so off guard every time. Yet I of all people try to remember that beautiful art can come from anywhere, and to assert the lineage of art onto it is a destructive, reductive choice that&rsquo;s pretty lame. Instead, basking in a piece&rsquo;s specificity can be a worthy love itself.</p>

<p>(I recently got to <strong>MEET</strong>* a Red Panda at the <a href="https://www.zoonewengland.org/franklin-park-zoo/">Franklin Park Zoo</a> and feed him grapes and it&rsquo;s far easier for to explain that it was a magical moment than to try and impart to anyone how magical it was. It reminds me that we all have a fundamentally unknowable interiority, which can be frightening at times but is also truly wonderful the more you can share.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>This is a nice way of saying they use the same shit over and over again. From metal-on-metal clanging to healing and death sounds, it used to really annoy me. Now it&rsquo;s verging on pleasant for nostalgia&rsquo;s sake, and I&rsquo;m not sure how I feel about that.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
