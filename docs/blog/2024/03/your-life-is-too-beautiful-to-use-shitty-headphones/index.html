<p>The average person listens to between two and four hours of music a day. Then there&rsquo;s podcasts and audiobooks, YouTube videos, phone calls - we listen to so much stuff all the time, yet most people simply don&rsquo;t care about <em>how</em> they listen to stuff and that makes me sad.</p>
<p>Wired earbuds <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/wired-headphones-2021-it-accessory">returned for a moment in 2021</a> so TikTok makers could whisper dramatically into the in-line microphone, but this one random report points to the <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/09/29/2525211/0/en/The-Global-True-Wireless-Stereo-Earbuds-Market-size-is-expected-to-reach-243-9-billion-by-2028-rising-at-a-market-growth-of-34-6-CAGR-during-the-forecast-period.html">&ldquo;true wireless stereo earbuds market&rdquo;</a> reaching $243.9 <strong>billion</strong> by 2028, while Apple alone reportedly sold <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/03/apple-airpods-business-grew-like-gangbusters-over-the-holidays.html">90 million pairs</a> of airpods in the holiday quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>And they suck! They do! Most wireless heaphones don&rsquo;t sound great! Putting aside that they make you look like a bit of a douchebag and are <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/neae8z/why-airpods-are-a-social-and-environmental-disaster">disastrous for the environment</a>, they simply aren&rsquo;t that good at the main thing they do - deliver high quality audio to your ears.</p>
<p>Think of getting better headphones like investing in car mats - they might not be a &ldquo;sexy&rdquo; purchase to you, but they will make your life better and you&rsquo;ll use them everyday. By investing in any decent pair of wired headphones you&rsquo;ll hear your music in new and beautiful ways, reduce ear fatigue, and find a cool new way to express your relationship with all the aural delights the world has on offer. What follows are my recommendations for headphones everyone should consider owning.</p>
<h2 id="on-your-ears-not-in-em">On Your Ears, Not In &lsquo;Em</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://koss.com/products/kph30i">Koss KPH 30i</a> are my favorite headphones, period. They don&rsquo;t have the aggressively 80s construction of the Koss Porta Pros, but they have a charming retro vibe and are light enough you forget you&rsquo;re wearing them - they perch on your head and cover your ears but aren&rsquo;t closed-back so you can hear the world around you, which reduces listening fatigue while sounding spacious and crisp. These should be everyone&rsquo;s default, straight-up. Every company should hand these out for anyone engaging with Zoom meetings at the least.</p>
<p>(They&rsquo;re also moddable - by swapping out the default earpads for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MQVHX84">comfier</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071VXQNR9">bigger</a> pads, you can deepen the soundstage substantially, making them sound even more premium. I&rsquo;ve done both to different pairs and they beat $300 headphones by huge margins. If you&rsquo;re extremely cool there&rsquo;s even Koss&rsquo; <a href="https://koss.com/collections/utility-series/products/kph40-utility">utility version</a>, which have an all-metal construction, so you&rsquo;re wearing even less and you can swap cables.)</p>
<h2 id="iems">IEMs</h2>
<p>Do you really like shoving something into your ear canal, for some reason? Fine! There are good reasons for earbuds - sound isolation, size, and&hellip; well that&rsquo;s about it. Honestly the aforementioned trendy <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMTN2AM/A/earpods-lightning-connector">Apple Earpods</a> aren&rsquo;t the worst, and it&rsquo;s worth noting that they can be bought with Lightning, USB-C, or 3.5mm connections to avoid adapters if you know what you&rsquo;re going to be plugging into. For $19, not bad!</p>
<p>However there&rsquo;s a massive world of earbuds that are higher quality and more likely to stay in your ears - they&rsquo;re affectionately referred to as &ldquo;chi-fi&rdquo; IEMs, a.k.a  Chinese high-fidelity in-ear monitors. They look like what musicians wear on stage but cooler and cheaper. This niche can be a bit hard to parse, but searching Amazon for &ldquo;IEM&rdquo; will give you hundreds of results and you can check reviews from there; I own <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089XW9FH5/">two pairs by KZ</a> and have enjoyed both.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the benefit here? Removable cables (with ear loops so they don&rsquo;t fall out!), larger drivers than most true wirless earbuds, and no freaking batteries to charge before tossing into a landfill. For less than $40 you can have a pair that sounds as good or better than airpods, shows personality, and don&rsquo;t have a countdown timer made of lithium in them. The worst case scenario is that you don&rsquo;t like the anime girl on the box.</p>
<p>(Nerd note: I&rsquo;m investigating the world of hammerhead earbuds, which don&rsquo;t go into your ear canal but instead sit outside of it (which I vastly prefer) presently, I&rsquo;ll edit the post when I find a great cheap pair.)</p>
<h2 id="the-big-guns">The Big Guns</h2>
<p>Do you need people to fuck off and leave you alone? Bring out the big guns - proper over-ear headphones provide isolation and even bigger drivers for higher quality. The watchword nowadays is &ldquo;active noise cancellation&rdquo;, but some people (like myself) can&rsquo;t use it because of the perceived inner ear pressure that comes from the technique of generating sound waves that cancel out noise, and ANC requires power and power means batteries.</p>
<p>Meanwhile something like the <a href="https://www.akg.com/Headphones/Professional%20Headphones/K52.html">AKG K52</a> cost $30 and do plenty of noise isolation on their own, thank you very much. Like the Koss &lsquo;phones you can swap the earpads out for more comfort, isolation, bass response, and/or breathability.</p>
<p>Want to treat yourself? Shitty premium true wireless earbuds or headphones cost either $20 or $400, and in between there is a dazzling array of over-ear headphones, because fundamentally nothing has changed about wired headphones in decades, and that&rsquo;s their strength. Great headphones from thirty years ago are great headphones today and will work with anything with a headphone jack.</p>
<p>The trick here is that there are tons of really low-quality wired headphones, almost all of them made by gaming companies who cater to gaudy aesthetics, ludicrous &ldquo;features&rdquo;, and the need to have a bad microphone to get toxic with every Tuesday night. So don&rsquo;t buy those!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Really, I&rsquo;m begging you at this point. You probably love music, or the sound of people&rsquo;s voices, or the white noise we sometimes need to forget the world we live in, and I think you want to hear it as best you can. If you&rsquo;re using trendy wireless earbuds or the headset your work gave you for customer service calls, you&rsquo;re looking through the world with grey-tinted glasses, missing out on texture, space, power and more in everything we listen to. You might get migraines or have sore ears or not care what you&rsquo;re listening to as long as there&rsquo;s something on. I know there&rsquo;s a lot else going on, but I&rsquo;m blaming your shitty headphones.</p>
