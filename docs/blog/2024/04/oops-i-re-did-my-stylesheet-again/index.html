<h1>Oops I Re-Did My Stylesheet Again</h1>

<p>Having no archive and habitually erasing all the evidence anwyays, it might not be obvious that I&rsquo;m the kind of person who redesigns their website every 6 months to a year. I&rsquo;ve had a personal website since middle school in one form or another - Blogger, Wordpress, Tumblr, then in college hand-crafted, deeply amateur HTML. We&rsquo;re way past the ship of Theseus at this point, past sports car getting rebuilt in the garage; it&rsquo;s some kind of mania.</p>
<p>The truth is I&rsquo;m not an amazing coder or web designer, but I&rsquo;m addicted to the immediate results. The other forms of creativity I engage in – mainly writing – take time and headspace, but web coding is the equivalent of making with my hands. I used to have to compulsively hammer the keyboard shortcut to refresh, like a monkey before tools; now I use <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> and it knows how to deliver that drug right to me every time I save.</p>
<p>So yeah, I re-did my website again, not <a href="https://wickedlyethan.com/notes/2024-03-17/" title="2024-03-17">even a month</a> after re-launching the whole dang site to actually start using it. Why? <em>WHY?</em></p>
<p>As I mentioned I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m that great a designer. Most recently I had been inspired by <a href="https://indexhibit.org/">Indexhibit</a> without thinking about why. Indexhibit is for artists, visual artists in particular, to show off their work – it&rsquo;s in the name and the structure of the code: there&rsquo;s an &ldquo;index&rdquo; and an &ldquo;exhibit&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m not a visual artist in the slightest, even though I am trying to take and post more <a href="https://wickedlyethan.com/photos/" title="Photos">photos</a>, so that structure doesn&rsquo;t make sense. I love text, I want to generate a corpus of words in a browser. I don&rsquo;t have a product to sell or a vibe to promote, and my site definitely isn&rsquo;t a resumé. It&rsquo;s part blog, part feedback-less Instagram, and it&rsquo;ll become anything, part playground. Therefore the Indexhibit structure wasn&rsquo;t working for me, and I had customized it enough to look like I had customized it, but not competently enough to look great.</p>
<p>New mission: <em>use as little CSS as possible</em> and delegate as many decisions to the browser as I can. I don&rsquo;t think browsers are perfect, especially as they race to <a href="https://keith.is/posts/souring-on-arc-browser/">engorge themselves with useless &ldquo;AI&rdquo; features</a>, but they can be relied upon to render words on a page well – they haven&rsquo;t abdicated that duty yet. Meanwhile the <a href="https://geminiquickst.art/">Gemini protocol</a> continues to intrigue me as an alternate internet, where it&rsquo;s all messages in bottles instead of industrial dark magic, so I&rsquo;m taking that ethos to my little static site.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m down to 37 lines of CSS before minify-ing, with only two classes. Here&rsquo;s the recipe:</p>
<ol>
<li>At the root we set line height and use Jim Fisher&rsquo;s <a href="https://jameshfisher.com/2024/03/12/a-formula-for-responsive-font-size/">formula for responsive text size</a>, made just a touch smaller than stock.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color-scheme">color-scheme</a> property isn&rsquo;t perfect, but it takes care of a lot, in particular colors that are high contrast and accessible, adapt for user preference, and come off as tech-y but not try-hard. Unless you&rsquo;re a dark mode user on Safari, in which case hyperlinks become unreadably dark for no reason - we&rsquo;ll get around to fixing that.</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-smooth">Smooth those fonts</a>. What fonts? Use the <a href="https://systemfontstack.com/">system font stack</a>. Again, great designers got paid lots of money, let them do it for you if you don&rsquo;t know better.</li>
<li>A couple of lines to set the paradigm to &ldquo;blog&rdquo;, a.k.a. readable text width, a dash of margin, and overrides to nav styles when needed, so I can use them appropriately but not have unsightly bullets everywhere.</li>
<li>Make the title a bit bigger, but no math required: you can just write &ldquo;xx-large&rdquo; for the font size and it doesn&rsquo;t do much, but it does enough.</li>
<li>Uhhh, that&rsquo;s it! Like I said, 36 lines of code. I ripped my hands off the steering wheel at this point. I used as many HTML5 elements as correctly as I know how and that takes care of a lot of the work for me.</li>
</ol>
<p>I checked my work against Robin Rendle&rsquo;s <a href="https://robinrendle.com/notes/the-smallest-css/">&ldquo;smallest CSS&rdquo; post</a> and was chuffed to find I had organically come to many of the same conclusions, and the same dumb bug in Safari. (Seriously, fuckin&rsquo; fix that!) I had to re-structure and standardize few of my templates, but that was it. Commit, sync, push.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing and posting more on here, and hopefully this re-design will let me stop thinking about anything other than that. This is my black t-shirt and black pants of the web; no more decision fatigue here. At least for a few months, right?</p>
