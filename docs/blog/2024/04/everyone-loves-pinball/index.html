<h1>EVERYBODY Loves Pinball</h1>

<p>It&rsquo;s true! Pinball is the game for all people of all ages, and there was nowhere better to be on Friday night than <a href="https://pintasticnewengland.com/">Pintastic New England</a> with friends, where $30 gets your free play on tables from across history, from <a href="https://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=3782"><em>Safecracker</em> (1996)</a> to <a href="https://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=1755"><em>Paragon</em> (1979)</a> to my drug of choice: Stern&rsquo;s excellently overwhelming <a href="https://sternpinball.com/game/jurassic-park/"><em>Jurassic Park</em> (2019)</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a pinball novice – the most pinball I&rsquo;ve played is <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Pinball:_Ruby_%26_Sapphire"><em>Pokémon Pinball: Ruby &amp; Sapphire</em> (2003)</a> on the Game Boy Advance. (My favorite incident was playing it on my phone instead of suffering through my own college graduation.) As such I&rsquo;m not very good at any particular table, but I find the variety between tables and the stimulus overload of lights and noises pretty close to addictive. From the same simple mechanic – keep the damn ball moving – you can have a huge variety of experiences and levels of complexity, all of which are delightfully obtuse and always adorned with gorgeous (if frequently horny) art.</p>
<p>Something I&rsquo;ve noticed after two visits to Pintastic is the complete cross-section of society who play pinball, from old men to punks to kids and families. (<a href="https://www.bowmarketsomerville.com/tenants/popspinball">Pop&rsquo;s Pinball Parlor</a> in Somerville is run by two hipster dudes, and groups like &ldquo;The Belles and Chimes of New England&rdquo; play there, what a vibe.)</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the pretty metal vibe of pinball machines themselves, which are <a href="https://youtu.be/Tmg5WOvPKpU?si=qMPo8Bf0fV_VUl3Q">insanely complicated</a> and temperamental, sometimes requiring ripping the table open and soldering on the fly. Play sessions are brutally short by default and only get more stressful the longer they go – between the three of us the most common reaction to anything happening was &ldquo;Wait WHAT&rdquo;, followed by &ldquo;SHIT!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other good news about pinball is that it&rsquo;s everywhere – pinball appears to have had a resurgence during the pandemic, like many vintage forms of gaming, and shows like Pintastic will only get bigger.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I&rsquo;ve anecdotally seen &ldquo;amusement centers&rdquo; popping up all over the area, taking over the hollowed-out husks of mall department stores and stuffing them with laser tag, VR booths, and trampoline parks – one nearby fittingly filled the corpse of a Toys R&rsquo; Us. These aren&rsquo;t for me and people my age per se, but they&rsquo;re great to see as an evolution of what I grew up on, maybe minus the cardboard-adjacent pizza and stained plastic pitchers of soda. (I will state authoritatively we had better arcade cabinets: we played <em>Time Crisis 2</em> (1997) and <em>Tekken 3</em> (1997), while the newer arcades are stocked with the aggressively mediocre <a href="https://rawthrills.com/">Raw Thrills</a> brand machines.)</p>
<p>Physical game spaces like <a href="https://level99.com/">Level 99</a> and the bonkers <a href="https://www.bodaborg.com/">Boda Borg</a> are a whole other taxonomy of play that, post-pandemic, appear to be having a resurgence as people want to get the fuck out of the house and hang out with the people they were separated from for so long.</p>
<p>All this to say that playing games in public is <em>back</em>, and pinball is the oldest institution around, so find your local flipper flophouse and I bet you&rsquo;ll have a great time.</p>
