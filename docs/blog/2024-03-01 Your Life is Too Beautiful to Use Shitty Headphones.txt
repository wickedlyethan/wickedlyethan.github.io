# Your Life is Too Beautiful to Use Shitty Headphones

The average person listens to between two and four hours of music a day. Then there's podcasts and audiobooks, YouTube videos, phone calls - we listen to so much stuff all the time, yet most people simply don't care about *how* they listen to stuff and that makes me sad.

Wired earbuds [returned for a moment in 2021](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/wired-headphones-2021-it-accessory) so TikTok makers could whisper dramatically into the in-line microphone, but this one random report points to the ["true wireless stereo earbuds market"](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/09/29/2525211/0/en/The-Global-True-Wireless-Stereo-Earbuds-Market-size-is-expected-to-reach-243-9-billion-by-2028-rising-at-a-market-growth-of-34-6-CAGR-during-the-forecast-period.html) reaching $243.9 **billion** by 2028, while Apple alone reportedly sold [90 million pairs](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/03/apple-airpods-business-grew-like-gangbusters-over-the-holidays.html) of airpods in the holiday quarter of 2021. 

And they suck! They do! Most wireless heaphones don't sound great! Putting aside that they make you look like a bit of a douchebag and are [disastrous for the environment](https://www.vice.com/en/article/neae8z/why-airpods-are-a-social-and-environmental-disaster), they simply aren't that good at the main thing they do - deliver high quality audio to your ears.

Think of getting better headphones like investing in car mats - they might not be a "sexy" purchase to you, but they will make your life better and you'll use them everyday. By investing in any decent pair of wired headphones you'll hear your music in new and beautiful ways, reduce ear fatigue, and find a cool new way to express your relationship with all the aural delights the world has on offer. What follows are my recommendations for headphones everyone should consider owning.

## On Your Ears, Not In 'Em

The [Koss KPH 30i](https://koss.com/products/kph30i) are my favorite headphones, period. They don't have the aggressively 80s construction of the Koss Porta Pros, but they have a charming retro vibe and are light enough you forget you're wearing them - they perch on your head and cover your ears but aren't closed-back so you can hear the world around you, which reduces listening fatigue while sounding spacious and crisp. These should be everyone's default, straight-up. Every company should hand these out for anyone engaging with Zoom meetings at the least.

(They're also moddable - by swapping out the default earpads for [comfier](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MQVHX84) or [bigger](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071VXQNR9) pads, you can deepen the soundstage substantially, making them sound even more premium. I've done both to different pairs and they beat $300 headphones by huge margins. If you're extremely cool there's even Koss' [utility version](https://koss.com/collections/utility-series/products/kph40-utility), which have an all-metal construction, so you're wearing even less and you can swap cables.)

## IEMs

Do you really like shoving something into your ear canal, for some reason? Fine! There are good reasons for earbuds - sound isolation, size, and... well that's about it. Honestly the aforementioned trendy [Apple Earpods](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMTN2AM/A/earpods-lightning-connector) aren't the worst, and it's worth noting that they can be bought with Lightning, USB-C, or 3.5mm connections to avoid adapters if you know what you're going to be plugging into. For $19, not bad!

However there's a massive world of earbuds that are higher quality and more likely to stay in your ears - they're affectionately referred to as "chi-fi" IEMs, a.k.a  Chinese high-fidelity in-ear monitors. They look like what musicians wear on stage but cooler and cheaper. This niche can be a bit hard to parse, but searching Amazon for "IEM" will give you hundreds of results and you can check reviews from there; I own [two pairs by KZ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089XW9FH5/) and have enjoyed both. 

What's the benefit here? Removable cables (with ear loops so they don't fall out!), larger drivers than most true wirless earbuds, and no freaking batteries to charge before tossing into a landfill. For less than $40 you can have a pair that sounds as good or better than airpods, shows personality, and don't have a countdown timer made of lithium in them. The worst case scenario is that you don't like the anime girl on the box.

(Nerd note: I'm investigating the world of hammerhead earbuds, which don't go into your ear canal but instead sit outside of it (which I vastly prefer) presently, I'll edit the post when I find a great cheap pair.)

## The Big Guns

Do you need people to fuck off and leave you alone? Bring out the big guns - proper over-ear headphones provide isolation and even bigger drivers for higher quality. The watchword nowadays is "active noise cancellation", but some people (like myself) can't use it because of the perceived inner ear pressure that comes from the technique of generating sound waves that cancel out noise, and ANC requires power and power means batteries.

Meanwhile something like the [AKG K52](https://www.akg.com/Headphones/Professional%20Headphones/K52.html) cost $30 and do plenty of noise isolation on their own, thank you very much. Like the Koss 'phones you can swap the earpads out for more comfort, isolation, bass response, and/or breathability. 

Want to treat yourself? Shitty premium true wireless earbuds or headphones cost either $20 or $400, and in between there is a dazzling array of over-ear headphones, because fundamentally nothing has changed about wired headphones in decades, and that's their strength. Great headphones from thirty years ago are great headphones today and will work with anything with a headphone jack. 

The trick here is that there are tons of really low-quality wired headphones, almost all of them made by gaming companies who cater to gaudy aesthetics, ludicrous "features", and the need to have a bad microphone to get toxic with every Tuesday night. So don't buy those! 

## Conclusion

Really, I'm begging you at this point. You probably love music, or the sound of people's voices, or the white noise we sometimes need to forget the world we live in, and I think you want to hear it as best you can. If you're using trendy wireless earbuds or the headset your work gave you for customer service calls, you're looking through the world with grey-tinted glasses, missing out on texture, space, power and more in everything we listen to. You might get migraines or have sore ears or not care what you're listening to as long as there's something on. I know there's a lot else going on, but I'm blaming your shitty headphones.
