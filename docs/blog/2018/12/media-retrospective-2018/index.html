<p>I&rsquo;ll never remember everything, and there&rsquo;s little things that I can&rsquo;t fit into these categories, but here&rsquo;s a retrospective of all the input I took in this year, all the thoughts I let invade my head to try and quiet it down a little bit, or conversely, wake it up from the modern malaise.</p>
<p>And yes, many of these are not even from this year, because I&rsquo;m not part of the intelligentsia that get to actually <em>keep up with</em> culture, thank you very much. This is the art and media that I got the chance to experience this year, alone or with friends and family, and there&rsquo;s so much good old stuff that who cares about recent? (Me. I do. But I can&rsquo;t afford it so, oh well.)</p>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t read as many as I wanted, only 18 this year, and truthfully many were graphic novels which is cheating, but oh well these are my favorite proper books I read this year:</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2018-media-retrospective/American-Wolf_Nate-Blakeslee.png" alt="American Wolf Cover"></p>
<h3 id="american-wolf-a-true-story-of-survival-and-obsession-in-the-west-by-nate-blakesleehttpswwwgoodreadscombookshow41078131-american-wolf-2017"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41078131-american-wolf">American Wolf: A True Story of Survival and Obsession in the West by Nate Blakeslee</a> (2017)</h3>
<p>Much like <em>Planet Earth</em>, my all-time favorite filmed thing ever, <em>American Wolf</em> brings me the same sense of comforting humility before nature, and the same flabbergasted exhaustion from how we attempt to shape it. As much anthropology as zoology, this was also a key text this year in trying desperately to reconcile with how different life across this country can be. Stories of families subsistence-hunting for caribou next to bureaucrats murdering wolves for farming conglomerates sit side by side to each other, all in the shadow of the beasts that truly rule Yellowstone.</p>
<h3 id="the-collapsing-empire-by-john-scalzihttpswwwgoodreadscombookshow30078567-the-collapsing-empire-2017"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30078567-the-collapsing-empire">The Collapsing Empire by John Scalzi</a> (2017)</h3>
<p>By throwing all sense of portentousness to the wind and instead filling this book with colorful cusses and characters, Scalzi makes sci-fi fun and engrossing in a way it recently hasn&rsquo;t been for me. The operative word in the title is <em>collapsing</em> - this is a story about society <em>as we know it</em> falling apart due to endless greed and inexorable changes in the cosmos. That sounds familiar somehow&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="keeper-of-the-lost-cities-by-shannon-messengerhttpswwwgoodreadscombookshow12842828-keeper-of-the-lost-cities-2012"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12842828-keeper-of-the-lost-cities">Keeper of the Lost Cities by Shannon Messenger</a> (2012)</h3>
<p>I want to direct this movie. It&rsquo;d be like <em>Harry Potter</em> but with the intensity dialed up a little bit and a less cohesive visual scheme - there&rsquo;s a grab-bag of technology and magic and cultures in here that shouldn&rsquo;t work but does thanks to simply solid storytelling, and a pace that kept me reading whenever I found a spare second. The central relationship of Sophie and the magical foster parents, who in recent past suffered a tragedy that left them daughter-less, is one of the most expertly played I&rsquo;ve ever read - nothing is certain, but the stakes are high and there&rsquo;s no simple answers either. This is also a story in which a protagonist with special powers is made sure that their powers are not cute or prophetic, but dangerous as <em>hell</em>, which is a reaction to the god-children like Potter and Rick Riordan&rsquo;s <em>The Lightning Thief</em> that I find very welcoming.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/2018-media-retrospective/new-yorker_ben-wiseman.png" alt="Illustration for the New Yorker by Ben Wiseman"></p>
<p>I am apparently in Pocket&rsquo;s top 1% of users, which is both a humblebrag and a shameful amount of time to be reading things that mostly depress me, especially in contrast to my earlier note about not reading enough fiction, which does the exact opposite.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/11/12/why-doctors-hate-their-computers">&ldquo;Why Doctors Hate Their Computers&rdquo;</a> by Atul Gawande (The New Yorker); a perfect article for considering the ways digitalization effects every part of our daily existence now, and a way to take a pause and be critical when you&rsquo;re the kind of person who loves technology just a bit too much.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/318588/The_great_video_game_exodus.php">&ldquo;The great video game exodus&rdquo;</a> by Simon Parkin (Gamasutra); The article that finalized my decision not to go into the game industry. Enough said.</li>
<li><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/05/poor-people-often-dont-survive-to-become-seniors-who-vote.html">&ldquo;Seniors Are More Conservative Because the Poor Don’t Survive to Become Seniors&rdquo;</a> by Ed Kilgore (New York Magazine); Sometimes political truths can be small, brutal pills instead of winding, complex webs of lies and what-ifs.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wbur.org/cognoscenti/2018/06/01/americans-unhappy-europe-anne-mackin">&ldquo;Americans Are Unhappier Than Europeans And Living Here Costs More. Why Stay?&rdquo;</a> by Anne Mackin (WBUR); A simple question with a lot of complex personal answers, but I&rsquo;ll admit I&rsquo;d never asked it before reading this, and I think in this day and age everyone should.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h2>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2018-media-retrospective/anthro_400x400.jpg" alt="The Anthropocene Reviewed"></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/anthropocene-reviewed"><em>The Anthropocene Reviewed</em></a> by John Green (Complexly and WNYC Studios); I could write so much about how this show has made me think so much, how it&rsquo;s made me feel both less and alone and truly alone, but instead I&rsquo;d say just go listen to it. Preferably on a drive to somewhere you can chat about all that you&rsquo;ve thought about.</li>
<li><a href="https://trumpconlaw.com/"><em>What Trump Can Teach Us About Con Law</em></a> by Elizabeth Joh and Roman Mars; &ldquo;what can we learn from all this?&rdquo; has become an important lens for our daily struggles, but this podcast takes that very literally. What can we learn about our flawed, vague, brilliant, frustrating, perversely sanctified constitution by &ldquo;examining the thoughts and tweets of America&rsquo;s fourty-fifth president.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-shipping-forecast/">&ldquo;The Shipping Forecast&rdquo;</a> from <em>99% Invisible</em>; learn the history of the dulcet, extremely British sounds of the BBC shipping forecast, a soft-spoken cipher of sailorly information that is as important as it is sublime.</li>

<p><img src="/images/blog/2018-media-retrospective/edith-finch.png" alt="What Remains of Edith Finch"></p>
<h3 id="what-remains-of-edith-finchhttpwwwgiantsparrowcomgamesfinch"><a href="http://www.giantsparrow.com/games/finch/">What Remains of Edith Finch</a></h3>
<p><em>(Giant Sparrow and Annapurna Interactive, 2017, PC)</em></p>
<p>Thinking about this game is like thinking about an amazing dream you had where you came out appreciating the fact you could wake up. The world I live in came into sharp relief after finishing <em>Edith Finch</em>, and I went and hugged my cat and called my dad. It also is the apex of the trend of short narrative-focused games that dominated my brain and calendar this year, and I hope its success is illuminating.</p>
<h3 id="subsurface-circularhttpsstoresteampoweredcomapp676820subsurface_circular-and-quarantine-circularhttpsstoresteampoweredcomapp853500quarantine_circular"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/676820/Subsurface_Circular/">Subsurface Circular</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/853500/Quarantine_Circular/">Quarantine Circular</a></h3>
<p><em>(Bithell Games, 2018, PC)</em></p>
<p>I had the great pleasure of meeting Mike Bithell at GDC 2018 this year, and beyond being a nice man willing to answer questions from a college student (unlike 90% of people at GDC), he also is creating a great new form of game - the two-hour anthology; Smart sci-fi stories told well while pushing narrative game mechanics in smart ways, smartly made on a budget that lets them be cheap and experimental but clearly successful for Bithell and co. I hope this kind of game catches on, because it&rsquo;s the kind of thing <em>I</em> want to make, dammit.</p>
<h3 id="titanfall-2httpswwwmicrosoftcomen-usptitanfall-2c0x2hnvh08fbactivetabpivotoverviewtab"><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/titanfall-2/c0x2hnvh08fb?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Titanfall 2</a></h3>
<p><em>(Respwan Interactive and EA Games, 2016, PC)</em></p>
<p>To quote Austin Walker, &ldquo;this is a game-ass video-game.&rdquo; <em>Titanfall 2</em> takes every design lesson we&rsquo;ve learned over a decade and sticks them all into a tight, incredibly smart, and surprisingly emotional campaign that&rsquo;s like main-lining great design. Never a dull a moment, always a good time.</p>
<p>Honorable Mention: <em>Dishonored 2</em> (Arkane Studios and Bethesda Softworks, 2016, PC). The first game I can think of I went back to because I flipped through the art book and just missed the craftsmanship of the world and had to see every detail. It breaks down at its ending a bit, but when it works it is completely enchanting.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2018-media-retrospective/spiderman-intospiderverse.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="spider-man-into-the-spider-versehttpsletterboxdcomfilmspider-man-into-the-spider-verse-2018-and-incredibles-2httpsletterboxdcomfilmincredibles-2-2018"><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse/">Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</a> (2018) and <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/incredibles-2/">Incredibles 2</a> (2018)</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m grouping these together because the lesson is similar: animation is a truly special, transcendent medium, and there are simply some stories that can be told better through it, despite what Disney itself <a href="https://nerdist.com/aladdin-hot-jafar-genie-best-reactions-twitter/">might be trying to assert</a>. These are fun, imaginative, happy films that you can let yourself get fully drenched in their colors and wit and messages for a while and come out with more energy than you came in with. In such an exhausting year that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<h3 id="wind-riverhttpsletterboxdcomfilmwind-river-2017-2017"><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/wind-river-2017/">Wind River</a> (2017)</h3>
<p>As a sort of companion piece to <em>American Wolf</em>, this harrowing and brutal drama creates a tone so strikingly different that it haunted me for weeks. I keep meaning to watch it again, but it also contains one of the most senseless, disturbing acts of violence I&rsquo;ve ever seen in a film, rendered dispassionately, seemingly a fact of life in the snowy mountains.</p>
<p>Honorable Mention: <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/annihilation/"><em>Annihilation</em></a> for the runner-up to <a href="https://youtu.be/iYlIwaUhGi8">most upsetting scene I&rsquo;ve ever seen</a> and for inspiring Dan Olson to make a fantastic essay on <a href="https://youtu.be/URo66iLNEZw">reading metaphors in film</a> that should be taught in schools everywhere.</p>
<p>Dishonorable Mention: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/movies/avengers-infinity-war-review.html"><em>Avengers: Infinity War</em></a> has soured over time for me because it truly is a lot of punching, some quipping, and then one of the most depressing, nihilistic, and unpleasant third acts I&rsquo;ve ever seen. I don&rsquo;t really <em>want</em> to watch this movie ever again, and I couldn&rsquo;t help but think about what it&rsquo;d be like to be a child watching your favorite heroes turn to ash on a 40-foot screen. If this is the <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDarkAgeOfComicBooks">&ldquo;Dark Age of Comic Movies&rdquo;</a> let&rsquo;s get it the hell over with and get back to having fun.</p>
<h2 id="tv">TV</h2>
<p>I <em>know</em>, it&rsquo;s the Golden Age of TV and all that but I find the pace of television absolutely exhausting, and unfortunately not much that I watched this year left a profound effect on me. I think there was another season of <em>Stranger Things</em>, or was that last year? Who knows! There&rsquo;s also no easy way for me to recount this, because I am utterly dependent on cataloging my media consumption on services like Letterboxd or Goodreads, so I need that but for TV.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2018-media-retrospective/the-terror.png" alt="The Terror"></p>
<h3 id="the-terrorhttpswwwamccomshowsthe-terror-amc"><a href="https://www.amc.com/shows/the-terror">The Terror</a> (AMC)</h3>
<p>No one watched this show as far as I can tell, but it&rsquo;s <em>Master and Commander</em> meets <em>The Thing</em>, and I loved it. A well-placed mystery at the center is surrounded by a tangled mess of relationships and British Royal Navy Nonsense and pretty amazing special effects, with some beautifully haunting moments.</p>
<h3 id="sharp-objectshttpsletterboxdcomfilmsharp-objects-hbo"><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/sharp-objects/">Sharp Objects</a> (HBO)</h3>
<p>This show is like going <em>en pointe</em> on a knife blade - you will be wound like piano wire for most of it, and the answers won&rsquo;t lesson the tension much. Much like its predecessor <em>Big Little Lies</em>, the audio mixing deserves a shout-out: many scene transitions are cross-mixed in a way where the next scene starts before the current one ends, as if Amy Adams&rsquo; Camille is constantly about to be hit by a car, or worse, the truth.</p>
<h3 id="the-marvelous-mrs-maiselhttpswwwamazoncomgpproductb077gm48yprefatv_feed_catalog---season-2-amazon"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077GM48YP/ref=atv_feed_catalog">The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</a> - Season 2 (Amazon)</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even done yet and I know this is one my absolute favorite things I&rsquo;ve watched this year. In part because I get to watch it with my girlfriend, which is wonderful because our tastes diverge and we&rsquo;re both picky enough so that we don&rsquo;t get to do that very often. <em>Maisel</em> makes us laugh so much that we have to pause it to catch up, but it also makes me blush with second-hand embarrassment intensely enough I have to leave the room. Every time a microphone is left unattended in a room I feel a sense of curious dread - &ldquo;oh know, what&rsquo;s she going to do <em>this time</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dishonorable Mention: <em>The Haunting at Hill House</em> (Netflix), which was doing so well until it shit itself with two of the worst last episodes since <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>. (Now <em>there&rsquo;s</em> a comparison for you.)</p>
<h2 id="videos">Videos</h2>
<p>Despite watching an inordinate amount of online video, I don&rsquo;t <em>like</em> a lot of it, and I remember even less. That&rsquo;s probably not a good sign.</p>
<h3 id="this-is-america-by-childish-gambino">This is America by Childish Gambino</h3>

<p>This video took the world by storm, and for good reason. With a sudden influx of <em>even more</em> attention it may have come to light that Donald Glover is <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/05/donald-glover-cant-save-you">kind of a dick</a>, but it&rsquo;s inarguable that he&rsquo;s an important artist making work that slaps people like me in the face, and that&rsquo;s good &lsquo;cos we deserve it.</p>

<p>(There is something incredibly soothing about watching John Green freak out. That&rsquo;s not weird is it?)</p>

<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<p>I have far less to say about music than probably any other medium, because I really only listen to what I like and put it on repeat until I&rsquo;m sick of it and then move on, one album at a time. I use music more for stimulation than for art, if we&rsquo;re being honest.</p>

<p>When I first got into punk when I was a kid, Rise Against was in the Tony Hawk games and that was neat, but they didn&rsquo;t grab me the way Bad Religion did or NOFX. Having spent the last couple of weeks going through their entire catalog obsessively, I think it&rsquo;s because they are as loudly &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo; as the former nor in any way careless the latter; Rise Against instead are incisive and deliberate, their protests spelled out in metaphor and allegory shouted. Songs like &ldquo;Prayer of the Refugee&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hero of War&rdquo; are the songs we need now, even more than the still truthful but brash &ldquo;Wolves in Wolves Clothing&rdquo; or &ldquo;Kyoto Now!&rdquo; of my youth.</p>
<h2 id="2019">2019</h2>
<p>I have no idea what&rsquo;s coming out next year. I honestly have no idea, I haven&rsquo;t been keeping track of the <em>current releases</em> the way I used to, especially after the couple of games I bought this year right as they game out turned out to be just &ldquo;okay&rdquo; instead of anything fantastic. Instead I think I&rsquo;ll continue my method of complete aimlessness, ingesting the media I want when I want instead of trying to keep up to date. Except <em>The Bodyguard</em> because apparently that&rsquo;s non-negotiable.</p>
<p>I also hope to write more as it all happens, because if you thought <em>this</em> was insufferably long, believe me when I say my actual thought trains are <em>much, much worse.</em> Going all-in on this shit is my prime directive; in years like this, it&rsquo;s most of what I&rsquo;ve got left.</p>
