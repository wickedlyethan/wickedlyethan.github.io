<p>Hi! I&rsquo;m Ethan! I&rsquo;m an aspiring writer from Massachusetts. Professionally I&rsquo;m a technical writer in healthcare and biotechnology despite studying game design in college.</p>
<p>I love books and movies, have a love-hate relationship with games, play drums, and am getting back into photography. I try to be thoughtful about media and tech - the things I love I really love and the stuff I hate I try to understand, at least.</p>
<p>I have a lot of stories I want to tell and am constantly struggling to carve out the time in life to write them, so I call myself a &ldquo;writer&rdquo; aspirationally for now!</p>
<p>I have a deeply adversarial relationship with platforms and social media, so part of my perennial tinkering with this site is to work that out. I hope I post stuff that people like, but if not then it&rsquo;s still a great exercise in creativity and finishing things!</p>
<p>Check out my <a href="https://wickedlyethan.com/now/">Now page</a> to see the latest.</p>
<h2 id="the-site">The site</h2>
<p>My little site is built on <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> and deployed to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> entirely through <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> on my M1 Macbook Air.</p>
<p>After years of struggling to come up with a great identity via design I decided to go as minimalist as possible – read more about it here: <a href="https://wickedlyethan.com/blog/2024/04/oops-i-re-did-my-stylesheet-again/">&ldquo;Oops I Re-Did My Stylesheet Again&rdquo;</a></p>
