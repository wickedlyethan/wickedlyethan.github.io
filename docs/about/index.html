<p>Hi! I&rsquo;m Ethan and I&rsquo;m a technical writer in biotechnology.</p>
<p>I love books and movies, have a love-hate relationship with games, play drums, and am getting back into photography. I try to be thoughtful about media and tech - the things I love I really love and the stuff I hate I try to understand, at least.</p>
<p>I have a lot of stories I want to tell and am constantly struggling to carve out the time in life to write them, so I call myself a &ldquo;writer&rdquo; aspirationally for now!</p>
<p>I have a deeply adversarial relationship with platforms and social media, so part of my perennial tinkering with this site is to work that out. I hope I post stuff that people like, but if not then it&rsquo;s still a great exercise in creativity and finishing things!</p>
<h2 id="now">Now?</h2>
<p>I just resigned from the longest job I&rsquo;ve ever had after getting recruited for a much better/cooler/higher-paying opportunity! I&rsquo;m nervous and excited and am having a real hard time giving a damn for the last two weeks I begrudgingly gave. â€“ 2024-04-07</p>
