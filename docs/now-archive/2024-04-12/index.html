I just resigned from the longest job I’ve ever had after getting recruited for a much better/cooler/higher-paying opportunity! I’m nervous and excited and am having a real hard time giving a damn for the last two weeks I begrudgingly gave.
Meanwhile I’m desperately awaiting warmer weather and turning 30 in a few weeks, which is a bit harrowing but mostly exciting.

<p><code>Last Updated: 2024-04-07</code></p>
<p>I just resigned from the longest job I&rsquo;ve ever had after getting recruited for a much better/cooler/higher-paying opportunity! I&rsquo;m nervous and excited and am having a real hard time giving a damn for the last two weeks I begrudgingly gave.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I&rsquo;m desperately awaiting warmer weather and turning 30 in a few weeks, which is a bit harrowing but mostly exciting.</p>
<h2 id="my-works-in-progress">My Works in Progress</h2>
<p>Indirectly inspired by <a href="https://www.personalkanban.com/personal-kanban-101">Personal Kanban</a> I try to limit the number of things I&rsquo;m working on to three. My current WIPs are:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Mars&rdquo; screenplay</li>
<li>&ldquo;My Vampire Ex-Girlfriend&rdquo; story treatment</li>
<li>Working on this website and blogging</li>
</ul>
<p>My <strong>forever project</strong> is downsizing our apartment and getting rid of stuff – we&rsquo;re in the phase of our life where we&rsquo;re shucking away all the hand-me-downs and stuff we combined when we moved together in college. It&rsquo;s really hard sometimes, but it&rsquo;s all in service of having less anxiety about how much we have and how hard it would be to move.</p>
